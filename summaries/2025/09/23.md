# Activity Summary for 23/9/2025

## 12:18:33
The log shows several code changes made between 12:08 and 12:13 on September 23, 2025, primarily focused on the `SliderItem` component and its associated styles.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\sliderItemHome\index.jsx`**:  This file underwent multiple revisions.  The initial version (12:08:27)  rendered a slider item with conditional button text and icons based on `item.media_type` (video, audio, or default). It used a `isKid` prop to differentiate content.  A later version (12:11:24) replaced `isKid` with `isKidsProfile`. The final version (12:13:20) removed the `isKidsProfile` prop and reverted the styling to a default red focus style.  The changes show an iterative process of adjusting conditional logic and removing features.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx`**: This file was modified twice (12:10:01 and 12:10:52), but the code content remains identical in both logs. The file is a React component responsible for rendering a page, fetching data (home data or page content using different APIs depending on the route), handling live content updates using `ApiGetNowPlaying`, and managing user authentication. It uses several custom hooks for virtualization, fixed focus, and context management.  The extensive use of `useEffect` hooks indicates complex state management and side effects, including handling user authentication, live content refreshes, and navigation events.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\genericButton\index.scss`**: This file, containing SCSS styles for a generic button component, was modified twice (12:11:38 and 12:13:10). The initial version included styles for both 'RED' and 'PURPLE' focused states. The second revision removed the 'PURPLE' styles, suggesting that the purple focused state functionality may have been removed.

In summary, the code changes show a development process involving adjustments to component rendering, conditional logic for button styling, and the removal of a kids profile specific style. The `src\views\page\index.jsx` file, responsible for page rendering and data fetching, shows a complex implementation.  The multiple changes to `SliderItem` suggest iterative refinement of its behavior and visual presentation. The removal of the 'PURPLE' styles from `genericButton` indicates a possible simplification or feature removal.
