# Activity Summary for 23/9/2025

## 12:18:33
The log shows several code changes made between 12:08 and 12:13 on September 23, 2025, primarily focused on the `SliderItem` component and its associated styles.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\sliderItemHome\index.jsx`**:  This file underwent multiple revisions.  The initial version (12:08:27)  rendered a slider item with conditional button text and icons based on `item.media_type` (video, audio, or default). It used a `isKid` prop to differentiate content.  A later version (12:11:24) replaced `isKid` with `isKidsProfile`. The final version (12:13:20) removed the `isKidsProfile` prop and reverted the styling to a default red focus style.  The changes show an iterative process of adjusting conditional logic and removing features.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx`**: This file was modified twice (12:10:01 and 12:10:52), but the code content remains identical in both logs. The file is a React component responsible for rendering a page, fetching data (home data or page content using different APIs depending on the route), handling live content updates using `ApiGetNowPlaying`, and managing user authentication. It uses several custom hooks for virtualization, fixed focus, and context management.  The extensive use of `useEffect` hooks indicates complex state management and side effects, including handling user authentication, live content refreshes, and navigation events.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\genericButton\index.scss`**: This file, containing SCSS styles for a generic button component, was modified twice (12:11:38 and 12:13:10). The initial version included styles for both 'RED' and 'PURPLE' focused states. The second revision removed the 'PURPLE' styles, suggesting that the purple focused state functionality may have been removed.

In summary, the code changes show a development process involving adjustments to component rendering, conditional logic for button styling, and the removal of a kids profile specific style. The `src\views\page\index.jsx` file, responsible for page rendering and data fetching, shows a complex implementation.  The multiple changes to `SliderItem` suggest iterative refinement of its behavior and visual presentation. The removal of the 'PURPLE' styles from `genericButton` indicates a possible simplification or feature removal.


## 13:18:48
The log shows extensive modifications to the SCSS stylesheets and JSX components of a Smart TV application, primarily focused on enhancing visual styling and focus handling.  The changes span from September 23rd, 2025, between 12:19 PM and 1:00 PM.


`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\themes\_genericButton.scss`:  This file defines CSS variables for button focus colors, initially set to `#{$base-color-3cat-red}`,  then updated to use a different color (`#{$base-color-3cat-kid-light-purple}`) within a `body.kid-mode` context.  A shadow color variable is added later.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\genericButton\index.scss`: This file contains the styles for a generic button component. Updates include refined styling (border, shadow, padding), and the use of the `--genericButton-focus-color` and `--genericButton-shadow-color` variables introduced in `_genericButton.scss`.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\colors.scss`: This file defines various color variables, categorized into "Normal" and "Kids" palettes. These color variables are heavily used throughout the other SCSS files.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\lastDaysItem\styles.scss`: This stylesheet is updated to incorporate focus styles using `$base-color-3cat-red` and its transparent variant, indicating a visual change upon focus.  The code also contains many lines prefixed with an underscore (`_`), which are likely comments or preprocessor directives specific to a stylesheet compilation system.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\accessibleContent\styles.scss` and `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\allCatalog\styles.scss`: Both files underwent multiple edits within a short time frame (12:26 PM - 12:26 PM).  The changes appear minor, suggesting debugging or iterative adjustments to layout and styling.  They share a lot of stylistic elements and also utilize color variables from `colors.scss`.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\lastDays\index.scss`: This file manages the styling for a "last days" view. Several updates are made, including adjustments to positioning and styling of elements like buttons, containers and row elements.  The styling uses many of the same techniques seen in other stylesheets.


`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\search\stylesFilters.css`:  This stylesheet focuses on filter elements within a search view, defining styles for buttons and containers.  It uses a linear gradient for the background.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\themes\_fixedFocus.scss`: This file is similar to `_genericButton.scss` but defines CSS variables (`--fixedFocus-focus-color`)  for focus styles, again adapting for kid mode.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\themes\_themes.scss`: This file imports various theme-related SCSS files, bringing together the styles defined in other theme files.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.scss`:  Styles are defined for a `fixed-focus` component that presumably provides visual focus indicators with variations for different shapes (round, square, etc.). It uses the `--fixedFocus-focus-color` variable.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.scss`: This file contains global styles for the application, including a debug layer, and styles related to focus states leveraging the `--fixedFocus-focus-color` variable.  It also includes a default `no-image` style.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\landscapeItem\styles.scss`, `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\styles.scss`, `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\portraitItem\styles.scss`, and `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\squareItem\styles.scss`: These files contain styles for various item components, all showing consistent use of focus styles using the `--fixedFocus-focus-color` variable and similar layout structures.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\styles.scss`: This stylesheet styles a generic row component, handling different row types (HERO, BANNER, etc.) with specific layout adjustments. It also includes styles for a "show all" element.


`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\contexts\authContext.jsx`: This React context manages user authentication, including different user types (GuestUser, KidUser).  It handles user login/logout, storage of user data, and manages the display of modals related to user registration.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\simpleFeaturedItem\index.jsx`: This React component renders a featured item. Several updates are made including conditional rendering of a favorite button based on whether it's a kid's profile.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx`:  This React component is the main page view, fetching and rendering data, handling loading states, errors, and user authentication.  It utilizes many of the other components and contexts defined elsewhere.  Multiple edits were made, suggesting significant refactoring or feature additions.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx`: This React component renders a generic row, dynamically choosing the appropriate item component based on the row type.  It handles showing "show all" buttons where appropriate.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.scss` and `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx`: This component renders a round item, including styles and focus handling.

A recurring pattern is the consistent use of CSS variables for focus styles, enabling easy customization across the application. The `_` prefix in many SCSS lines is also a recurring element, possibly indicating a preprocessor convention for comments or unused code. The heavy use of  `data-*` attributes within the JSX components suggests a custom framework or library for handling focus management and navigation.  The application seems to be designed with support for multiple user types and varying screen sizes.  There's also a significant amount of live data integration and handling via several API calls.


## 14:18:34
The log shows extensive modifications to the styling and functionality of round-shaped items and rows within a Smart TV application, likely between 13:18 and 14:17 on September 23, 2025.

**`roundItem` Component (`index.jsx` and `styles.scss`):**  The `RoundItem` component underwent several iterations. Initially, it focused on displaying an image or text, implementing focus actions using `registerFocusAction` and `unregisterFocusAction`.  Later updates involved:

* **Styling changes:** The border color was modified to use CSS variables (`--roundItem-border-color`) dynamically, controlled by the `kid-mode` class for different themes.  The size of the round element was also made dynamic using `--roundItem-size`. The background color was also made dynamic using `--roundItem-background-color`.

* **Functional changes:** A `data-block-focus-down` attribute was added to handle focus on the next element which was handled before using the `isLastRow` prop.


**`roundRow` Component (`index.jsx` and `styles.scss`):** The `RoundRow` component displays a row of `RoundItem` components. Key updates include:

* **Kids mode support:**  Additional rendering of item titles (`roundItemTitle`) below the round items was introduced specifically for the kids profile. Styling for this was added to `styles.scss`.

* **Wrapper and Styling:**  A `roundItemWrapper` div was added to each `RoundItem`, enabling easier styling control, including text alignment adjustments for different profiles. The `styles.scss` file was extensively modified to style these wrappers and titles. Font family was set to "Bw 3Cat" for kids mode.

**SCSS Files (`styles.scss`, `_roundItem.scss`, `_themes.scss`, `_global.scss`, `fixedFocus.scss`):**  These files show the evolution of the application's styling system.  The major changes include the heavy use of CSS variables for responsive design and theming, particularly for:

* **Border Colors:** Using `--roundItem-border-color` and `--fixedFocus-focus-color` to handle different themes and profiles (regular vs. kids).

* **Sizes:** Employing `--roundItem-size`, `--roundRow-height`, and `--fixedFocus-roundRow-size` to dynamically adjust the layout for the regular and kids modes.

* **Margins:** Using `--fixedFocus-roundRow-margin-right` to manage the spacing between round items.


**`colors.scss`:** This file defines various color variables which are used across many files, notably expanding the color palette for the kids mode with new purple shades and a transparent color.

**`Page` Component (`index.jsx`):**  This component manages data fetching and rendering of the entire page which includes the `RoundRow` component. The updates within this file are related to managing and updating the data displayed on the page, handling errors, and managing user authentication.  It interacts heavily with different API endpoints and internal context.

In summary, the code changes reflect a significant refactoring effort to improve the application's responsiveness, theming capabilities, and visual presentation, especially for the kids profile. The use of CSS variables makes the code more maintainable and allows for easier customization.  The changes were made incrementally, with multiple edits to the same files within a short period.
