# Activity Summary for 15/9/2025

## 8:43:47
The `index.jsx` file, modified on September 15, 2025, at 8:41:17, is a React component responsible for rendering a side menu.  The component heavily utilizes React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`), and interacts with multiple contexts (`authContext`, `settingsContext`, `capabilitiesContext`, `virtualizationContext`) to manage authentication, settings, capabilities, and virtualization state.

The code manages two levels of menu (`mnuL1Data`, `mnuL2Data`) dynamically generated based on user type and settings.  A significant portion of the code deals with menu navigation and state management, including functions to open, close, and navigate between menu levels. Functions like `openLevel1Menu`, `closeLevel1Menu`, `openLevel2Menu`, `closeLevel2Menu`, and `exitMenu` control the visual state of the menu.  The menu also incorporates a search functionality (`attachSearchAtTheBeginning`).

State is managed using several `useState` hooks, including `show_1st_mnu`, `show_2nd_mnu`, `navigate_2nd_mnu`, `selL1`, `selL2`, and `language`.  A `useRef` hook (`selected_op_mnu`) is used to track the currently selected menu option.

The `useEffect` hooks handle updating the menu based on location changes, navigation actions, and authentication status.  The component also interacts with a global `nav` object (presumably a navigation library), using functions like `nav.focusById` and `nav.move.right` for focus management.

The code includes functions to handle user actions, such as changing users (`fnDoChangeUser`), exiting the application (`fnExitApp`), and navigating to different sections of the application (`navigateTo`).  Helper functions like `normalizeText`, `getClassNameFromPath2`, and `generateStandardString` are used for data manipulation and formatting.  `generateL1MenuData`, `generateL2MenuData_Explora`, and `generateL2MenuData_User` are responsible for generating the menu data structures.  The `isOptionInMenu` function checks if a given path is present in the menu.  The component also handles language selection based on the browser's language settings.  Finally, the component uses `useMemo` to optimize the rendering of thematic blocks within the menu.

The log shows multiple updates to the `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\index.jsx` file between 8:50:22 and 9:16:18 on September 15, 2025.  These updates appear to be iterative refinements and bug fixes, with no major structural changes to the component.  The changes are primarily focused on improving the menu's functionality and responsiveness.  Specifically, there are minor adjustments to how the menu handles user authentication, navigation, and the display of menu items based on user type ("kid" or otherwise).  There's also a consistent pattern of adding error handling and edge case considerations throughout the code.  The `useEffect` hooks are repeatedly modified to ensure proper menu state updates.  

The `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\dataHandler.js` file was updated once at 8:53:37 on September 15, 2025. This update involves helper functions for menu data handling, including functions to generate menu data, set body classes, and check if an option is in the menu.  Changes here likely reflect improvements to the underlying data structures and logic used to populate and manage the side menu.

The `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\style.scss` file underwent several updates between 9:01:07 and 9:16:18 on September 15, 2025. These changes are primarily focused on styling aspects of the side menu, such as the appearance of menu items, their focus states, and transitions between menu levels.  There is a notable addition of styling rules related to "kid mode," suggesting a visually distinct menu for younger users.  The iterative changes point to adjustments in visual presentation and responsive design, aiming for a cleaner and more user-friendly appearance.  The modifications to image opacity (`img { opacity: 0.3; }` and then `opacity: 1;`) shows specific attention to visual details.  The final change adds a rule to handle the removal of icons in kid mode.
