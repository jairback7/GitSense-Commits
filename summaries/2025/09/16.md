# Activity Summary for 16/9/2025

## 0:08:35
The log shows modifications to two files: `landscapeItem.jsx` and `page.jsx`.  The `landscapeItem.jsx` file underwent minor, seemingly inconsequential changes between 16:48:28 and 16:52:40 on September 15, 2025. The only notable difference in the code revisions is a correction in line  `(imgData?.image === null)`, where a missing `?` was added before `image`.  This suggests a bug fix related to image handling.

The `page.jsx` file was modified twice, at 16:55:08 and 16:55:24 on the same day. These changes are more substantial.  The second revision appears to be a continuation of the first; it extends a lengthy `useEffect` hook without altering the core functionality significantly.  Both revisions heavily involve data fetching (`ApiHome`, `ApiContent_NO_PROMISE`, `ApiGetNowPlaying`, `ApiGetNowPlayingSelector`), data manipulation (`getAllNowPlayingSelectorChannelsIds`, `removeItemFromDirectesChildren`, `replaceDirectesChildrenInHomeData`, `replaceItemInDirectesChildren`, `mergeData`, `filterChildren`), state management (using React hooks like `useState` and `useRef`), and routing (`useNavigate`, `useLocation`).  The code manages live content updates (`live_refresh_interval`), error handling (redirects for unauthorized access), and UI elements based on capabilities and user authentication.  The second revision possibly adds functionality related to handling partial screen rendering or menu behavior, based on the incomplete last line.  The overall pattern reveals a complex React component responsible for a dynamic home screen or page, likely incorporating features for live TV, user authentication, and data visualization.
