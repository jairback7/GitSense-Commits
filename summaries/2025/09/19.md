# Activity Summary for 19/9/2025

## 9:16:29
The log shows updates to the styling of a side menu for a smart TV application, primarily focusing on colors and layout.  The `_menu.scss` file was modified twice (8:41:03 and 8:45:53), adding a `--menu-circle-selected-color` variable to handle the color of selected menu items in both the standard and kid modes.  The changes involved defining various CSS custom properties (`--menu-bg-color`, `--submenu-bg-color`, etc.) using Sass variables based on a `$base-color-3cat-` prefix. These variables were defined in `colors.scss` at 8:46:17.  This file contains color definitions for both normal and kid modes.

The `style.scss` file (updated at 8:47:11) contains extensive styling for the side menu's structure, including first and second-level menus, using the CSS variables defined in `_menu.scss`.  The code demonstrates a complex menu system with nested levels, icons from `side-menu-icons.png`, hover/focus states, and styling adjustments for different menu items (e.g., "session," "search," etc.).  There's significant use of `background-position` to manage icon placement within the menu structure.  The styles also incorporate transitions for smoother animations.  The file includes extensive styling for states like `open-1st-level`, `open-2nd-level`, and `navigating-2nd-level`. The changes in `style.scss` directly reflect the new color variables introduced in `_menu.scss`, ensuring consistency across the application's themes.


## 10:16:31
The log shows multiple revisions to the codebase of a Smart TV application's side menu component (`index.jsx`) and its associated styles (`_menu.scss`) and data handling logic (`dataHandler.js`).  The most significant changes occur between 9:30 AM and 9:45 AM on September 19th, 2025.

**`index.jsx` (Multiple Revisions):** This file undergoes several revisions, primarily focused on refining the menu's functionality and behavior.  These changes include additions and modifications to event handling (e.g., `CustomEvent`, `Event`), navigation logic using `react-router-dom`, and state management using `useState` and `useRef`.  The addition of the `act` import in later revisions suggests potential improvements for testing asynchronous operations. The core logic for handling menu data, including selection and navigation between levels, remains consistent but is detailed and complex.  A `Search` option is added to the menu.

**`_menu.scss` (Minor Revisions):**  This file contains SCSS code defining styles for the side menu. Two very similar revisions at 9:38 AM  involve minor adjustments, likely fixing a very small issue in the syntax related to  `--menu-circle-selected-color` property value.  The styles are distinctly separated for "kid-mode" and normal mode, indicating a customized user experience.


**`dataHandler.js` (Minor Revisions):** This JavaScript file contains functions responsible for manipulating and processing menu data. It contains functions like `getClassNameFromPath`, `generateStandardString`, `generateL1MenuData`, `generateL2MenuData_Explora`, `generateL2MenuData_User`, `isOptionInMenu`,  `generateEXTRAID`, and others.  Minor changes appear at 9:38 and 9:39 AM  primarily in `generateL2MenuData_User` suggesting adjustments to how the user menu items are structured for different user types (kid or adult).  There are commented out sections of code suggesting experimentation and iterative refinement.


The overall pattern indicates a focused effort on enhancing the side menu's user experience, specifically by improving navigation, handling user authentication states,  and adjusting menu items according to user type (kid mode or normal mode). The numerous revisions to `index.jsx` suggest an iterative development process with a focus on testing and refining the menu's interactive elements.
