# Activity Summary for 19/9/2025

## 9:16:29
The log shows updates to the styling of a side menu for a smart TV application, primarily focusing on colors and layout.  The `_menu.scss` file was modified twice (8:41:03 and 8:45:53), adding a `--menu-circle-selected-color` variable to handle the color of selected menu items in both the standard and kid modes.  The changes involved defining various CSS custom properties (`--menu-bg-color`, `--submenu-bg-color`, etc.) using Sass variables based on a `$base-color-3cat-` prefix. These variables were defined in `colors.scss` at 8:46:17.  This file contains color definitions for both normal and kid modes.

The `style.scss` file (updated at 8:47:11) contains extensive styling for the side menu's structure, including first and second-level menus, using the CSS variables defined in `_menu.scss`.  The code demonstrates a complex menu system with nested levels, icons from `side-menu-icons.png`, hover/focus states, and styling adjustments for different menu items (e.g., "session," "search," etc.).  There's significant use of `background-position` to manage icon placement within the menu structure.  The styles also incorporate transitions for smoother animations.  The file includes extensive styling for states like `open-1st-level`, `open-2nd-level`, and `navigating-2nd-level`. The changes in `style.scss` directly reflect the new color variables introduced in `_menu.scss`, ensuring consistency across the application's themes.


## 10:16:31
The log shows multiple revisions to the codebase of a Smart TV application's side menu component (`index.jsx`) and its associated styles (`_menu.scss`) and data handling logic (`dataHandler.js`).  The most significant changes occur between 9:30 AM and 9:45 AM on September 19th, 2025.

**`index.jsx` (Multiple Revisions):** This file undergoes several revisions, primarily focused on refining the menu's functionality and behavior.  These changes include additions and modifications to event handling (e.g., `CustomEvent`, `Event`), navigation logic using `react-router-dom`, and state management using `useState` and `useRef`.  The addition of the `act` import in later revisions suggests potential improvements for testing asynchronous operations. The core logic for handling menu data, including selection and navigation between levels, remains consistent but is detailed and complex.  A `Search` option is added to the menu.

**`_menu.scss` (Minor Revisions):**  This file contains SCSS code defining styles for the side menu. Two very similar revisions at 9:38 AM  involve minor adjustments, likely fixing a very small issue in the syntax related to  `--menu-circle-selected-color` property value.  The styles are distinctly separated for "kid-mode" and normal mode, indicating a customized user experience.


**`dataHandler.js` (Minor Revisions):** This JavaScript file contains functions responsible for manipulating and processing menu data. It contains functions like `getClassNameFromPath`, `generateStandardString`, `generateL1MenuData`, `generateL2MenuData_Explora`, `generateL2MenuData_User`, `isOptionInMenu`,  `generateEXTRAID`, and others.  Minor changes appear at 9:38 and 9:39 AM  primarily in `generateL2MenuData_User` suggesting adjustments to how the user menu items are structured for different user types (kid or adult).  There are commented out sections of code suggesting experimentation and iterative refinement.


The overall pattern indicates a focused effort on enhancing the side menu's user experience, specifically by improving navigation, handling user authentication states,  and adjusting menu items according to user type (kid mode or normal mode). The numerous revisions to `index.jsx` suggest an iterative development process with a focus on testing and refining the menu's interactive elements.


## 12:16:38
The log shows multiple revisions to the `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu` directory, primarily focusing on the `index.jsx` file and its associated stylesheet (`style.scss`).  The `index.jsx` file underwent extensive modifications between 11:16:30 and 12:11:49 on September 19th, 2025.  These changes primarily involved refinements to the side menu's functionality and visual presentation.

**`index.jsx` (multiple timestamps):**  The numerous revisions to `index.jsx` reflect iterative development.  The core logic for handling menu states (`show_1st_mnu`, `show_2nd_mnu`, `navigate_2nd_mnu`, `selL1`, `selL2`), user authentication (`isAuthenticated`, `activeUser`), and navigation (`navigateTo`, `navigate`) remained consistent. However, there were  substantial additions and adjustments to functions managing menu behavior (e.g., `openLevel1Menu`, `openLevel2Menu`, `exitMenu`, `manageFocused`),  handling user interactions (e.g., mouseovers, clicks), and adapting the menu based on user type (kid or adult).  The most notable changes include replacing `.png` image imports with `.svg` images (12:07:27 and 12:11:49) for improved scalability and performance.

**`style.scss` (multiple timestamps):** The `style.scss` file was modified between 11:32:30 and 12:03:29 on September 19th, 2025. These changes focused primarily on improving the visual aspects of the menu.  Specific adjustments were made to:

*   Positioning and sizing elements of the first and second-level menus.
*   Styling of menu items, including hover effects and focused states.
*   The responsiveness of the menu's animation and transitions.
*   Minor tweaks to icon positioning and styling within menu items.
*   Refinement of the visual style for different menu states (e.g., `open-1st-level`, `open-2nd-level`, `navigating-2nd-level`).

The frequent updates to both `index.jsx` and `style.scss` suggest a process of iterative design and development, aiming for improved user experience and visual appeal of the side menu component. The changes show a focus on making the component responsive and adaptable to various user states and preferences.


## 13:16:33
The provided code represents a React component (`Page`) responsible for rendering a TV home screen or content page.  Significant changes occur between the different timestamps.

The `index.jsx` file underwent several revisions on September 19th, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions: fetching and displaying data based on the current route ('home' or other content pages).  The data fetching utilizes several API calls (`ApiHome`, `ApiContent_NO_PROMISE`, `ApiGetNowPlaying`, `ApiGetNowPlayingSelector`). The component manages loading states, errors, user authentication, and live content updates.  It also heavily uses React hooks for state management and side effects (e.g., `useEffect`, `useState`, `useRef`).  The component incorporates virtualization (`useVirtualizedRows`) to optimize rendering performance.

**Key Changes Across Revisions:**

* **12:30:12:** Initial version of the component, fully functional, including live data refresh logic using `setInterval`.  The `getHomeData` function uses `settingsData?.home_id` for both user types.

* **12:37:46:** A minor modification to `getHomeData`. If `arrOfChIds` is empty, the data is set directly and the loading state is updated without waiting for `refreshLives`.  This improves performance when live content is not available. The `settingsData?.home_id` is used for both user types, potentially a bug.

* **12:40:46:**  The `useEffect` hook with the dependency array `[location]` is modified to also include `activeUser`. This ensures re-fetching of data based on changes to the active user. The `getHomeData` function now correctly uses `settingsData?.child_home_id` for kid users.


* **12:42:01:** No significant changes detected compared to the previous revision. The code appears largely the same.


**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

* Extensive use of asynchronous operations and promises for API calls.
* Error handling for authentication failures (Unauthorized/Token expired).
* Conditional rendering based on user capabilities (live support, Shaka Player support).
* Complex data manipulation functions (`checkTimeFrame`, `mergeData`, `filterChildren`, etc.) to manage and update the `pageData` state.
* Use of `useRef` to maintain mutable values across renders.
* Event listeners for various custom events (`menu:navigate`, `evChangeUser`).

In summary, the code represents a complex component responsible for rendering dynamic, personalized home screens and content pages,  handling asynchronous data fetching, live updates, user authentication and various user interactions.  The revisions primarily focus on bug fixes, performance enhancements, and the addition of logic for correctly handling user types (adult vs. child).
