The log shows updates to the styling of a side menu for a smart TV application, primarily focusing on colors and layout.  The `_menu.scss` file was modified twice (8:41:03 and 8:45:53), adding a `--menu-circle-selected-color` variable to handle the color of selected menu items in both the standard and kid modes.  The changes involved defining various CSS custom properties (`--menu-bg-color`, `--submenu-bg-color`, etc.) using Sass variables based on a `$base-color-3cat-` prefix. These variables were defined in `colors.scss` at 8:46:17.  This file contains color definitions for both normal and kid modes.

The `style.scss` file (updated at 8:47:11) contains extensive styling for the side menu's structure, including first and second-level menus, using the CSS variables defined in `_menu.scss`.  The code demonstrates a complex menu system with nested levels, icons from `side-menu-icons.png`, hover/focus states, and styling adjustments for different menu items (e.g., "session," "search," etc.).  There's significant use of `background-position` to manage icon placement within the menu structure.  The styles also incorporate transitions for smoother animations.  The file includes extensive styling for states like `open-1st-level`, `open-2nd-level`, and `navigating-2nd-level`. The changes in `style.scss` directly reflect the new color variables introduced in `_menu.scss`, ensuring consistency across the application's themes.
