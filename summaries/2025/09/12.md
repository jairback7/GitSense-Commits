# Activity Summary for 12/9/2025

## 9:07:58
The log shows two nearly identical updates to `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platformConfig.js` within a minute of each other (8:31:58 and 8:32:38 on 12/9/2025).  The changes are minor: the default platform in the `getPlatform` function changed from `"hbbtv"` to `"browser"`.  The rest of the file remained the same.  This file defines functions to detect the platform (tizen, webOS, Hisense, LG, HbbTV, browser), determine screen resolution (adjusting a scale factor for 720p vs 1080p), and retrieve the OS version based on the detected platform, using platform-specific APIs (webOS, Tizen).  The code includes specific handling for injecting the webOSTV.js library for webOS devices.  The resolution configuration dynamically adjusts based on window size and a potential config flag (`window.appConfig?.test_app?.disable720p`).
