# Activity Summary for 10/9/2025

## 17:08:39
The log shows multiple updates to the `genericRow` component and its styles, along with changes to the `navigationRoute` function and the `sideMenu` component.  The majority of changes revolve around navigation and menu handling.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx`**: This file underwent several revisions between 16:12:00 and 16:44:02. The core functionality remained consistent, focusing on rendering various row types (`LANDSCAPE`, `MINI`, `PORTRAIT`, etc.) and handling navigation (`navFunction`).  Significant changes include modifications to the `generateShoAllElement` function, altering how navigation is triggered for collection rows.  Initially, it passed `rowData` and `rowData.id`, then it was updated to pass `rowData.link` and `rowData.link.data.id`, and finally settled on passing just `rowData`.  The `onClick` handler within this function shows evolving logic for navigation based on the `isCollectionRow` condition.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\styles.scss`**: This file was updated twice (16:12:52 and 16:17:39), but the content remained identical in both versions, suggesting a potential accidental duplicate commit or a version control error. The styles define various classes for different row types, controlling aspects such as padding, width, and height.  The `item-show-all` class styles the "show all" element displayed when more items are available in a row.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\router\navigationRoute.js`**: This file saw continuous refinement between 16:29:18 and 16:45:08.  The major changes involved improving the logic for determining the `routeUrl` based on different `contentType` and `link` properties within the input `item` object.  Specifically, there was a significant change in how collection routes (`/c/...`) were handled.  There were also changes in how the `title` and `id` properties were derived, showing an improvement in robustness by incorporating fallback options.  The final version adds checks to explicitly set `routeObj.state.contentType` to 'collection' when a collection link is detected and uses `item.h1` for the title and `idPage` for the ID in this situation. It then updates the url to `/c/${link.data.id}`.


**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\dataHandler.js` and `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\index.jsx`**: These files (updated at 17:04:48 and 17:07:20 respectively) contain code for managing the side menu.  The `dataHandler.js` file provides helper functions for manipulating menu data and setting body classes based on the current route. The `index.jsx` file handles menu rendering, navigation, and user interactions, incorporating functions from `dataHandler.js` and the updated `navigationRoute`.  The `SideMenu` component uses the `generateL1MenuData`, `generateL2MenuData_Explora`, `generateL2MenuData_User`, `isOptionInMenu` and other functions from `dataHandler.js` to manage menu rendering and selection.  It also interacts with the `navigationRoute` to handle navigation.  These changes demonstrate a significant refactoring of the side menu functionality, primarily centered on improved state management and navigation.

In summary, the code changes reflect iterative development focused primarily on enhancing the application's navigation and menu systems. The `genericRow` component updates center on improving the handling of different row types and associated navigation actions. The `navigationRoute` file received multiple updates refining the routing logic, particularly for collection-type items. The `sideMenu` component changes implemented a more robust menu system with improved navigation and rendering.


## 21:08:36
The log shows multiple updates to the `index.jsx` file within the `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu` directory,  and one update to a stylesheet `index.scss` file in the  `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\onboarding\usersScreen` directory.  There's also a series of changes to the `platformConfig.js` file.


**`index.scss` (10/9/2025, 17:10:14):** This file contains styles for a user selection screen (`.users_view`). Styles are defined for titles, bubbles representing users, and user information display, including visual states like focus.  The styles extensively use specific font families ("Bw 3Cat") and background images from the `../../../assets/images` directory.


**`index.jsx` (Multiple Updates):**  This React component manages a side menu.  Significant changes across multiple updates include:


* **10/9/2025, 17:09:00:** Initial version of the side menu component, defining its structure and interactions.  The code heavily utilizes React hooks (`useCallback`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useState`),  and interacts with multiple contexts (`useAuthContext`, `useSettings`, etc.). The menu uses nested levels (Level 1 and Level 2), making use of functions for menu item generation and navigation.  A global `window.AppMenu` object is created and managed for state across different functions.


* **10/9/2025, 17:13:15 & 10/9/2025, 17:19:05 & 10/9/2025, 17:19:25:** These updates refine the menu's functionality.  The most significant change between the 17:19:05 and 17:19:25 timestamps is the inclusion of `setGuestUser` and `getLoggedUsers` functions from the `useAuthContext` hook within the `SideMenu` component. This suggests a modification to the user authentication and handling logic.  The `fnDoChangeUser` function is modified to handle the cases where logged-in users are present and absent.


* **10/9/2025, 17:27:16:** This update modifies the `useEffect` hook that handles authentication, adding `activeUser` to the dependency array. This ensures the effect runs again when the active user changes.


**`platformConfig.js` (Multiple Updates):** This file handles platform-specific configurations.  Key updates involve:

* **10/9/2025, 17:14:32:** Initial version or a major revision detecting the platform (e.g., HbbTV, Tizen, webOS, etc.) based on the user agent. It includes logic to dynamically inject the `webOSTV.js` library if the platform is webOS. It also configures the screen resolution based on window dimensions.


* **10/9/2025, 17:28:29 & 10/9/2025, 17:28:51:** These updates modify the default platform detection to "browser" unless specific TV platforms are detected. This potentially simplifies the setup and makes the code more compatible with non-Smart TV environments.


Recurring elements across the `index.jsx` updates include consistent use of utility functions (`normalizeText`, `getClassNameFromPath2`, etc.) and managing menu state via `window.AppMenu`.  The evolution of the `fnDoChangeUser` function suggests a progressive refinement of user handling and navigation within the application.
