# Activity Summary for 10/9/2025

## 17:08:39
The log shows multiple updates to the `genericRow` component and its styles, along with changes to the `navigationRoute` function and the `sideMenu` component.  The majority of changes revolve around navigation and menu handling.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx`**: This file underwent several revisions between 16:12:00 and 16:44:02. The core functionality remained consistent, focusing on rendering various row types (`LANDSCAPE`, `MINI`, `PORTRAIT`, etc.) and handling navigation (`navFunction`).  Significant changes include modifications to the `generateShoAllElement` function, altering how navigation is triggered for collection rows.  Initially, it passed `rowData` and `rowData.id`, then it was updated to pass `rowData.link` and `rowData.link.data.id`, and finally settled on passing just `rowData`.  The `onClick` handler within this function shows evolving logic for navigation based on the `isCollectionRow` condition.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\styles.scss`**: This file was updated twice (16:12:52 and 16:17:39), but the content remained identical in both versions, suggesting a potential accidental duplicate commit or a version control error. The styles define various classes for different row types, controlling aspects such as padding, width, and height.  The `item-show-all` class styles the "show all" element displayed when more items are available in a row.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\router\navigationRoute.js`**: This file saw continuous refinement between 16:29:18 and 16:45:08.  The major changes involved improving the logic for determining the `routeUrl` based on different `contentType` and `link` properties within the input `item` object.  Specifically, there was a significant change in how collection routes (`/c/...`) were handled.  There were also changes in how the `title` and `id` properties were derived, showing an improvement in robustness by incorporating fallback options.  The final version adds checks to explicitly set `routeObj.state.contentType` to 'collection' when a collection link is detected and uses `item.h1` for the title and `idPage` for the ID in this situation. It then updates the url to `/c/${link.data.id}`.


**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\dataHandler.js` and `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\index.jsx`**: These files (updated at 17:04:48 and 17:07:20 respectively) contain code for managing the side menu.  The `dataHandler.js` file provides helper functions for manipulating menu data and setting body classes based on the current route. The `index.jsx` file handles menu rendering, navigation, and user interactions, incorporating functions from `dataHandler.js` and the updated `navigationRoute`.  The `SideMenu` component uses the `generateL1MenuData`, `generateL2MenuData_Explora`, `generateL2MenuData_User`, `isOptionInMenu` and other functions from `dataHandler.js` to manage menu rendering and selection.  It also interacts with the `navigationRoute` to handle navigation.  These changes demonstrate a significant refactoring of the side menu functionality, primarily centered on improved state management and navigation.

In summary, the code changes reflect iterative development focused primarily on enhancing the application's navigation and menu systems. The `genericRow` component updates center on improving the handling of different row types and associated navigation actions. The `navigationRoute` file received multiple updates refining the routing logic, particularly for collection-type items. The `sideMenu` component changes implemented a more robust menu system with improved navigation and rendering.
