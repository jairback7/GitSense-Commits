# Activity Summary for 22/9/2025

## 16:04:38
The log shows multiple revisions to `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\style.scss` between 15:42:56 and 15:44:50 on September 22, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on styling a side menu, specifically adjusting the appearance of first and second-level menus (.mnu-level-1 and .mnu-level-2).  Several attributes are modified across these revisions, including width, background color, positioning, and icon placement.  There's significant use of CSS variables (e.g., `var(--menu-focused-row-color)`), suggesting a theming system.

The most noticeable change is in the path to an image asset within the `.explora` section of the first-level menu.  Initially, the path was `./../../assets/icons/ic_fletxa_simple_dreta.png` but this was updated to `../../assets/images/ic_fletxa_simple_dreta.png` and later had `background-repeat: no-repeat;` added at 15:44:20.  Minor adjustments to vertical positioning of the icon within `.ic_mes_explora`  (top value changed from 15px to 13px) are also visible between 15:44:20 and 15:44:50.

The code consistently addresses styling for different menu states:  `.focused`, `.selected`, `.open-1st-level`, `.open-2nd-level`, and `.navigating-2nd-level`.  These revisions likely reflect iterative improvements to the visual feedback and responsiveness of the side menu's interactive elements.  The frequent updates within a short timeframe suggest rapid prototyping or debugging.
