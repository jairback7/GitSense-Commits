# Activity Summary for 22/9/2025

## 16:04:38
The log shows multiple revisions to `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\style.scss` between 15:42:56 and 15:44:50 on September 22, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on styling a side menu, specifically adjusting the appearance of first and second-level menus (.mnu-level-1 and .mnu-level-2).  Several attributes are modified across these revisions, including width, background color, positioning, and icon placement.  There's significant use of CSS variables (e.g., `var(--menu-focused-row-color)`), suggesting a theming system.

The most noticeable change is in the path to an image asset within the `.explora` section of the first-level menu.  Initially, the path was `./../../assets/icons/ic_fletxa_simple_dreta.png` but this was updated to `../../assets/images/ic_fletxa_simple_dreta.png` and later had `background-repeat: no-repeat;` added at 15:44:20.  Minor adjustments to vertical positioning of the icon within `.ic_mes_explora`  (top value changed from 15px to 13px) are also visible between 15:44:20 and 15:44:50.

The code consistently addresses styling for different menu states:  `.focused`, `.selected`, `.open-1st-level`, `.open-2nd-level`, and `.navigating-2nd-level`.  These revisions likely reflect iterative improvements to the visual feedback and responsiveness of the side menu's interactive elements.  The frequent updates within a short timeframe suggest rapid prototyping or debugging.

The log shows several updates to SCSS files related to the avatar component in a side menu and styles for a search view, along with a JavaScript file managing platform configuration.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\avatar\index.scss`**: This file underwent multiple revisions between 18:05:02 and 18:09:10.  The primary changes involved the `.logo` class, switching the `background-image` URL from a Google Cloud Storage URL to a local asset (`../../../assets/images/menu_logo_sx3.png`). The `.session-icon` class also changed its `background-image` source from an inline image to `../../../assets/images/ic_usuari.png`, and  `background-repeat` was added. A `//TODO` comment regarding `chid_image` was also added and remained.  These modifications suggest a shift towards using local image assets.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platformConfig.js`**: This file was updated at 18:06:01.  The key update involves platform detection and configuration, dynamically adjusting the application's scale based on screen resolution (720p or 1080p).  The code explicitly handles various Smart TV platforms (Tizen, webOS, Hisense, LG, HbbTV), injecting the `webOSTV.js` library for webOS devices and utilizing different methods to retrieve the OS version for each platform.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\search\styles.scss`**: This file was updated three times between 18:11:19 and 18:11:54. The main change was in the `.searchTextBar` class, replacing the `background-image` URL in the `::before` pseudo-element with a local SVG asset (`../../assets/images/ic_cercador.svg`).  The `background-repeat` property was also explicitly set to `no-repeat` in one of the revisions.  The frequent updates to this file, with minimal changes each time, suggest iterative refinement of the styling. Many comments containing underscores suggest debugging comments.

In summary, the code changes primarily reflect a transition to local image assets for UI components and the implementation of robust platform detection and configuration logic to optimize the application's behavior across different Smart TV platforms.  The multiple, minor changes to the search view styles indicate an iterative design process.
