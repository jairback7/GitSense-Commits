For the file `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\detail\index.jsx`:

A minor but significant change occurred between 9:30:47 and 9:31:26 on 5/12/2025. Specifically, the line `mediaData.menu = seasonData.menu;` within the `ApiSeries` callback inside the `handleMediaData` function was commented out.

**File: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\detail\index.jsx`**

*   **Timestamp of Significant Change:** The file was modified between 5/12/2025, 9:30:47 and 5/12/2025, 9:31:26.
*   **File-Specific Updates:**
    *   Within the `handleMediaData` asynchronous function, a specific line of code was commented out. The line `mediaData.menu = seasonData.menu;` was changed to `//mediaData.menu = seasonData.menu;`. This indicates that the `menu` property is no longer being directly assigned from `seasonData.menu` in this context, or that this assignment has been temporarily disabled.
*   **Content Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
    *   The file is a React component (`SeriesDetail`) responsible for displaying detailed information about series or media content.
    *   It heavily utilizes React hooks such as `useEffect`, `useState`, and `useRef` for managing component lifecycle, state, and references.
    *   Extensive API integrations are present, with calls to `api_v2/favorites`, `api_v2/series`, `api_v2/media`, and `api_v2/watchInProgress` for fetching and managing data.
    *   It imports a wide array of UI components (e.g., `Spinner`, `ImageCropper`, `BackButton`, `ErrorModal`, `UserModal`, `InfoGroup`, `GenericButton`, `TimeLine`, various `FocusableItem` types, `ParentalControl`, `AudioAndSubtitlesConfig`) and utility functions (`getNavigationRoute`, `getLogoImage`, `useText`, `FavoritesMemory`, `baseHandleSignIn`, `baseHandleRegister`, `baseHandleGuest`).
    *   The component handles different media types (`SERIES`, `MEDIA`) and dynamically loads related content, clips, episodes, and watch-in-progress data.
    *   It incorporates authentication, parental control, and site analytics contexts (`useAuthContext`, `useParentalControlContext`, `useSitecatalyst`).
    *   Navigation logic (`navigate`, `nav.focus1stElementInContainer`) is embedded for handling user interaction and focus management within different content sections (`VIDEOS`, `AUDIOS`, `SEASONS`, `CLIPS`, `EXTRES`, `RELATED`).
    *   Styling is applied via `styles.scss` and `styles.kids.scss`, suggesting a design adapted for different user profiles or themes.

## 3:46:40
The log indicates a single file, `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\detail\index.jsx`, underwent a minor modification between 5/12/2025, 9:30:47, and 5/12/2025, 9:31:26.

The key change is within the `handleMediaData` asynchronous function. Specifically, in the success callback for the `ApiSeries` call, the line `mediaData.menu = seasonData.menu;` was commented out. This change, occurring within less than a minute, suggests a quick adjustment, potentially to temporarily disable or remove the assignment of the `menu` property from `seasonData` to `mediaData` when handling media that is either a clip or an episode.

**File-specific updates for `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\detail\index.jsx`:**
*   **Timestamp 5/12/2025, 9:30:47**: The `handleMediaData` function included a line `mediaData.menu = seasonData.menu;` to transfer menu data from season data to the media data object.
*   **Timestamp 5/12/2025, 9:31:26**: This line was commented out (`//mediaData.menu = seasonData.menu;`), effectively preventing the `menu` property from being assigned in this specific part of the logic.

**Patterns or recurring elements in the content:**
*   The `index.jsx` file is a large React component, likely responsible for a detailed view of series or media content.
*   It extensively uses React hooks like `useEffect`, `useState`, and `useRef` for managing component lifecycle, state, and element references.
*   The component heavily relies on various API calls (e.g., `ApiSeries`, `ApiSeasons`, `ApiMedia`, `ApiExtres`, `ApiClips`, `ApiRelated`, `ApiGetWatchInProgress`, `ApiSetFavorite`, `ApiRemoveFavorite`) to fetch and manage data related to content, user progress, and favorites.
*   Global state management and utilities are accessed through `window.AppGlobal`, `useAuthContext`, `useParentalControlContext`, and `useSitecatalyst`.
*   Data handling functions (`handleSeriesData`, `handleMediaData`, `loadContentData`, `loadSeasonChapters`, `loadWatchInProgressData`) are crucial for populating the view with relevant information and managing loading states.
*   Styling includes both general and kids-specific stylesheets (`styles.scss`, `styles.kids.scss`).
*   The component handles different content types (`MEDIA_TYPES.SERIES`, `MEDIA_TYPES.MEDIA`) based on the URL.
*   The `useEffect` hooks manage initial data loading, content ID changes, and focus management based on the current UI section.

## 7:19:48
The primary change recorded is within the file `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\detail\index.jsx`.

A minor modification was introduced between 5/12/2025, 9:30:47 and 5/12/2025, 9:31:26. Specifically, within the `handleMediaData` asynchronous function, inside the success callback for an `ApiSeries` call, the line `mediaData.menu = seasonData.menu;` was commented out. This indicates that the `menu` property of `mediaData` is no longer being assigned from `seasonData.menu` in this context. The rapid succession of timestamps suggests a quick adjustment or refinement of this specific data assignment.

## 8:19:44
In the file `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\detail\index.jsx`, a specific code modification occurred.

At **5/12/2025, 9:31:26**, a line within the `handleMediaData` asynchronous function was commented out. Specifically, the assignment `mediaData.menu = seasonData.menu;` was changed to `//mediaData.menu = seasonData.menu;`. This modification took place within the callback function of an `ApiSeries` call, which is executed when fetching season data for a media item. The purpose of this change likely involves preventing the `menu` property from being updated or assigned to `mediaData` from the `seasonData`.

The previous state of the file was recorded at **5/12/2025, 9:30:47**, showing this line active.

This single modification indicates a focused adjustment to how `mediaData` is processed or enriched after an API call, specifically related to the `menu` property of season data.

## 9:19:44
In `src\views\detail\index.jsx`, a minor but notable change was committed between `5/12/2025, 9:30:47` and `5/12/2025, 9:31:26`. Specifically, within the `handleMediaData` asynchronous function, inside the success callback of the `ApiSeries` call, the line `mediaData.menu = seasonData.menu;` was commented out. This adjustment indicates a modification in how menu data is assigned or handled for media items (clips or episodes) that belong to a series. The close timestamps suggest a rapid follow-up edit to an initial commit.
