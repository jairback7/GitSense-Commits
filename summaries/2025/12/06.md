*   **Timestamp of Significant Change:** The file was modified between 5/12/2025, 9:30:47 and 5/12/2025, 9:31:26.
*   **File-Specific Updates:**
    *   Within the `handleMediaData` asynchronous function, a specific line of code was commented out. The line `mediaData.menu = seasonData.menu;` was changed to `//mediaData.menu = seasonData.menu;`. This indicates that the `menu` property is no longer being directly assigned from `seasonData.menu` in this context, or that this assignment has been temporarily disabled.
*   **Content Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
    *   The file is a React component (`SeriesDetail`) responsible for displaying detailed information about series or media content.
    *   It heavily utilizes React hooks such as `useEffect`, `useState`, and `useRef` for managing component lifecycle, state, and references.
    *   Extensive API integrations are present, with calls to `api_v2/favorites`, `api_v2/series`, `api_v2/media`, and `api_v2/watchInProgress` for fetching and managing data.
    *   It imports a wide array of UI components (e.g., `Spinner`, `ImageCropper`, `BackButton`, `ErrorModal`, `UserModal`, `InfoGroup`, `GenericButton`, `TimeLine`, various `FocusableItem` types, `ParentalControl`, `AudioAndSubtitlesConfig`) and utility functions (`getNavigationRoute`, `getLogoImage`, `useText`, `FavoritesMemory`, `baseHandleSignIn`, `baseHandleRegister`, `baseHandleGuest`).
    *   The component handles different media types (`SERIES`, `MEDIA`) and dynamically loads related content, clips, episodes, and watch-in-progress data.
    *   It incorporates authentication, parental control, and site analytics contexts (`useAuthContext`, `useParentalControlContext`, `useSitecatalyst`).
    *   Navigation logic (`navigate`, `nav.focus1stElementInContainer`) is embedded for handling user interaction and focus management within different content sections (`VIDEOS`, `AUDIOS`, `SEASONS`, `CLIPS`, `EXTRES`, `RELATED`).
    *   Styling is applied via `styles.scss` and `styles.kids.scss`, suggesting a design adapted for different user profiles or themes.
