# Activity Summary for 8/12/2025

## 0:24:31
The provided log details two very close changes to the `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\detail\index.jsx` file. Both changes occurred on 5/12/2025, at 9:30:47 and 9:31:26 respectively.

The key change identified between these two timestamps is in the `handleMediaData` asynchronous function. Specifically, the line `mediaData.menu = seasonData.menu;` was commented out in the later update (9:31:26).

This indicates a minor adjustment to how `menu` data from `seasonData` is handled and assigned to `mediaData` within the `SeriesDetail` component, suggesting that this particular assignment is no longer desired or necessary. The near-instantaneous nature of the two commits points to a quick refinement or a brief debugging step.

Specifically, within the `handleMediaData` asynchronous function, the line `mediaData.menu = seasonData.menu;` was commented out. This change suggests a potential refactoring or temporary disabling of the `menu` property assignment for `mediaData` when processing `seasonData`.
