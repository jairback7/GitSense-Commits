*   **Modular Scripting**: Scripts are clearly categorized with comments (e.g., "// 01 UPGRADE", "// 02 LOCAL DEVELOPMENT MODES") and often chained using `npm run` for composite tasks (e.g., `upgrade`, `package:launcher_app:webos:all`).
*   **Output Directory Structure**: Builds consistently target `dist/` subdirectories, often organized by platform and environment (e.g., `dist/smarttv`, `dist/hosted_apps/smarttv_dev`).
*   **Cloud Deployment**: Google Cloud Storage (`gsutil`) is the chosen platform for deploying hosted web applications, with distinct buckets for different environments and application types.

The project's `package.json` (modified 28/11/2025, 7:51:58) details a comprehensive build, development, and deployment pipeline for a `3cat_smarttv` application. It uses Vite for local development and builds, targeting multiple platforms including webOS, Tizen, HbbTV, and general SmartTV across development, preproduction, and production environments. Key scripts include an "upgrade" system for managing version, build number, date, and environment variables, various local development modes, specific build commands for different platforms and environments, and preview scripts. Notably, it includes detailed sections for packaging "launcher apps" and placeholder "TODO" sections for "embedded apps" for webOS and Tizen. Deployment scripts leverage `gsutil` to push "hosted webapps" to Google Cloud Storage buckets (e.g., `gs://smartv-dev`, `gs://hbbtv-pro`) with cache control. Core dependencies include React and React Router, while dev dependencies cover linting (ESLint), CSS pre-processing (Sass), and various utilities.

The `src/components/items/rowItems/simpleFeaturedItem/index.jsx` file (modified 1/12/2025, 18:25:12) defines a React functional component named `FeaturedItem`. This component displays a featured content item with an image, information group, and interactive buttons for main actions (like "watch now" or "listen now") and favoriting. It utilizes React hooks for state management (`isFavorite`, `itemData`) and memoization (`useMemo`) for image optimization. A significant aspect is its sophisticated focus management for smart TV environments, using `registerFocusAction` and `unregisterFocusAction` from a custom registry, along with `data-group` and `blockMovement` attributes for navigation via remote control or keyboard. The component dynamically sets button text and icons based on `item.media_type` and conditionally renders the favorite button based on `isKidsProfile` or specific `custom_action` values.

The `src/router/navigationRoute.js` file underwent two rapid modifications on 1/12/2025. The first entry at 18:26:55 shows a `getNavigationRoute` function responsible for constructing internal application routes based on various properties of an `item` object (e.g., `media_type`, `contentType`, `slug`). It handles diverse content types such as `stream`, `media`, `collection`, `series`, and `menu_link`, mapping them to specific URL structures. It explicitly prevents navigation for `upcoming_event` items. A notable part of this version was special handling for items with `item.data.custom_action === 'enable_child_mode'` or `item.data.slug === 'infantil'`, both of which would trigger a `callback()` and redirect to `/home`. The subsequent modification at 18:27:32 refined this logic by removing the special `infantil` slug check within the `item.data.type == 'page'` block. This means that pages with the `infantil` slug will now follow the general `/page/${item.data.id}` routing, while the `enable_child_mode` custom action still redirects to `/home`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Multi-platform and Multi-environment Support**: The project consistently targets different smart TV platforms (webOS, Tizen, HbbTV) and distinguishes between development, preproduction, and production environments across builds, packaging, and deployments.
*   **Vite-based Workflow**: Vite is the core tool used for both local development and all production-ready builds.
*   **Focus on Smart TV User Experience**: There is a clear emphasis on navigation and interaction suitable for smart TV interfaces (e.g., remote control), evident in the extensive focus management logic within `FeaturedItem` and the packaging/deployment scripts for various TV platforms.
*   **Modular React Components**: UI components are built in a modular fashion, combining smaller, specialized components and custom hooks.
*   **Dynamic Content Handling**: Both the `FeaturedItem` component and the `getNavigationRoute` function demonstrate dynamic content adaptation, whether it's setting action buttons based on media type or determining navigation paths based on content attributes.
*   **Structured Versioning and Deployment**: The `package.json` includes dedicated scripts for versioning, build numbers, and automated deployments to cloud storage, indicating a structured release process.
*   **Special Handling for Kids/Child Mode**: Both the `FeaturedItem` and `navigationRoute.js` contain logic related to `isKidsProfile` or `enable_child_mode`/`infantil` actions, suggesting features for managing child-specific content or profiles.
