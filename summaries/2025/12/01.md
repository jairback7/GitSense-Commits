## 0:35:19
The `package.json` file located at `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\package.json`, last updated on `28/11/2025, 7:51:58`, defines the project configuration and a comprehensive set of scripts for the `3cat_smarttv` application.

**Key File-Specific Updates and Information:**

*   **Project Metadata:** The project is named `3cat_smarttv`, is private, currently at version `0.9.4`, build `319`, with a recorded date of `2025-11-13 21:13:34`. It uses `type: "module"`.
*   **Scripts Structure:** The `scripts` section is highly organized with numbered categories (01 to 11), indicating a well-structured development and deployment workflow.
    *   **Version Management (01 UPGRADE):** Scripts exist to manage and upgrade project `version`, `build`, `date`, and `env` using dedicated Node.js scripts (`check-versions.js`, `check-build-number.js`, `check-date.js`, `update-env-from-package.js`).
    *   **Local Development (02 LOCAL DEVELOPMENT MODES):** Various `vite` commands facilitate local development with different modes (`dummy`, `development`, `preproduction`, `production`) and host options.
    *   **Device Builds (03, 04, 05):** Dedicated `vite build` scripts are defined for `webOS`, `Tizen`, `SmartTV`, and `HbbTV` platforms, each supporting `development`, `preproduction`, and `production` modes. There are also `watch` scripts for SmartTV and HbbTV.
    *   **Preview and Start (06 PREVIEW):** Scripts for previewing built distributions for `webOS`, `Tizen`, and `HbbTV` using `vite preview`, along with `start` commands to build and preview simultaneously.
    *   **Linting (07 LINTING):** An `eslint` command is included for code quality checks.
    *   **Device Packaging (08, 09):**
        *   `package:launcher_app`: Scripts use `package-launcher-apps.cjs` to package launcher applications for `webOS` and `Tizen` across `DEV`, `PRE`, and `PRO` environments, with convenience scripts to package all environments.
        *   `package:embedded_app`: Similar structure for embedded applications but marked as `TODO` with placeholder `echo` commands.
    *   **Hosted Webapp Builds (10 HOSTED WEBAPP BUILDS):** `vite build` commands are defined to create hosted webapps for `SmartTV` and `HbbTV` for `development`, `preproduction`, and `production` environments, outputting to `dist/hosted_apps/`.
    *   **Deployment (11 DEPLOY HOSTED WEBAPPS (GCS)):** Scripts use `gsutil` to deploy the built hosted webapps for `SmartTV` and `HbbTV` to specific Google Cloud Storage buckets (e.g., `gs://smartv-dev`, `gs://hbbtv-pre`) with a `Cache-Control` header set to `max-age=5`.
*   **Dependencies:** Key runtime dependencies include `react`, `react-dom`, `react-router-dom`, `whatwg-fetch`, `youboralib` for analytics, and `jwt-decode`.
*   **DevDependencies:** Development dependencies highlight the use of `vite` and its plugins (`@vitejs/plugin-legacy`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`), `eslint` for linting, `sass` for styling, `dotenv` for environment variables, and various utility libraries like `lodash`, `ua-parser-js`, `uuid`, and `js-cookie`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Vite-centric Workflow:** The project heavily leverages `vite` for building, serving, and previewing, indicating a modern frontend development setup.
*   **Multi-Platform Targeting:** There's a clear emphasis on supporting multiple smart TV platforms: `webOS`, `Tizen`, `SmartTV`, and `HbbTV`.
*   **Environment-Specific Builds/Deploys:** A consistent pattern of `development` (`dev`), `preproduction` (`pre`), and `production` (`prod`/`pro`) environments is applied across builds, packaging, and deployments, ensuring proper staging.
*   **Automated Packaging and Deployment:** The inclusion of Node.js scripts for versioning and packaging, along with `gsutil` commands for deployment to GCS, points to an automated CI/CD-friendly workflow.
*   **Modular Scripting:** The use of `npm run <script> && npm run <another_script>` and grouped `all` scripts demonstrates an effort to create modular and easily executable build/deploy chains.
*   **Comments for Organization:** The scripts are well-commented and categorized, making the `package.json` file highly readable and maintainable.
