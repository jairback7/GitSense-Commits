# Activity Summary for 15/12/2025

## 5:26:52
**File: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss`**
- **10/12/2025, 10:53:52**: Initial styles for an external content modal were defined. This includes a fixed overlay, a popup container with a specific width, padding, border-radius, and box-shadow. The popup is divided into `popupLeft` (for images and platform logos) and `popupRight` (for promotional text, platform details, and buttons), with detailed styling for their layout, dimensions, and text properties.
- **10/12/2025, 11:26:25**: A minor style adjustment was made to the `.platformLogoImg` class, adding `max-width: 130px;` to limit the maximum width of platform logos within the modal.

**File: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useExternalEmission.jsx`**
- **11/12/2025, 11:56:30**: A new `useExternalEmission` React hook was introduced. This hook uses `useMemo` to determine if an external emission is currently "live" based on `event_start_emission` and `event_end_emission` timestamps. If not live but scheduled for the future, it formats the start emission date using `formatExternalEmissionDate`.
- **11/12/2025, 12:04:57**: Debugging `console.log` statements were added to log `startEmission`, `endEmission`, and `nowUTC` values.
- **11/12/2025, 12:13:27**: An attempt was made to adjust the timestamp passed to `formatExternalEmissionDate` by multiplying `dates.event_start_emission` by 1000, suggesting a potential unit mismatch (seconds vs. milliseconds).
- **11/12/2025, 12:14:06**: The change from 12:13:27 was reverted, restoring `formatExternalEmissionDate(dates.event_start_emission)`.
- **11/12/2025, 12:15:39**: No functional code changes were observed in this entry, identical to the previous version.

**File: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\utils\time.js`**
- **11/12/2025, 12:14:15**: This utility file contains various functions for handling and formatting dates and times. Notably, `formatExternalEmissionDate` was defined, which takes a timestamp (presumably in seconds, as it internally multiplies by 1000 for `Date` object creation) and formats it into a localized weekday, day, and time string. This update is directly relevant to the `useExternalEmission` hook.

**File: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\detail\index.jsx`**
- **10/12/2025, 17:43:44**: This extensive update for the `SeriesDetail` component established its core functionality. It imports numerous React hooks, API services (for favorites, series, media, watch-in-progress), routing, UI components (spinner, modals, buttons, media info, parental control, player), and utility functions. State management was set up for various data points like API responses, loading status, errors, content sections, seasons, and user interactions (favorites, watch progress). Key functions `handleSeriesData` and `handleMediaData` were defined to fetch and process content details, integrate watch-in-progress data, and manage licensing. It also includes an `init` function to orchestrate initial data loading and related content, and `useEffect` hooks for component lifecycle and navigation focus management.
- **12/12/2025, 13:36:02**: Within `handleMediaData`, in the `ApiSeries` callback, `mediaData.menu = seasonData.menu;` was added to ensure the menu data is updated when season data is available.
- **12/12/2025, 13:37:23**: No functional code changes.
- **12/12/2025, 13:42:30**: An `else` block was added to the `if (seasonData.seasons?.length > 0)` condition in `handleMediaData` to ensure `mediaData.menu` and `setCollectionData` are updated even if no seasons are present.
- **12/12/2025, 13:43:02**: The `setCollectionData(mediaData);` call at the beginning of `handleMediaData` was commented out, potentially deferring this state update.
- **12/12/2025, 13:44:16**: The changes from the previous two timestamps were reverted: `setCollectionData(mediaData);` was uncommented, and the `else` block for seasons in `handleMediaData` was removed.
- **12/12/2025, 13:56:02**: A typo in the import path for `SimplePlayer` was corrected from `simplesPlayer` to `simplePlayer`.
- **12/12/2025, 13:59:37**: Navigation focus logic was activated and refined. Specifically, `focusResults()` was uncommented for 'VIDEOS', 'AUDIOS', and 'SEASONS' sections, and focus management (setting `groupLastFocusedID` and `resetSelectedElementScrollTop`) was explicitly added for the 'CLIPS' section.
- **12/12/2025, 14:03:46**: The condition `if (seasonData.seasons?.length > 0)` in `handleMediaData` was changed to `if (seasonData.season_count > 0)`, altering how the presence of seasons is checked.
- **12/12/2025, 14:04:48**: The change from 14:03:46 was reverted, restoring the check to `if (seasonData.seasons?.length > 0)`.
- **12/12/2025, 14:14:44**: In `handleMediaData`, the assignment `mediaData.menu = seasonData.menu;` and the `loadClips` call for video media types were moved outside the `if (seasonData.seasons?.length > 0)` block, making them unconditional when handling media that is a clip or episode within a series.
- **12/12/2025, 14:15:45**: No functional code changes.
- **12/12/2025, 14:18:16**: In `handleMediaData`, a call to `loadExtres(mediaData.season_data?.series_id);` was added for `mediaData.media_type === 'video'`, ensuring "extres" data is also loaded for video content within a series context.
- **12/12/2025, 14:21:46**: `setIsLoadding(false);` within the `ApiSeries` callback in `handleMediaData` was commented out.
- **12/12/2025, 14:22:00**: The change from 14:21:46 was reverted, uncommenting `setIsLoadding(false);`.
- **12/12/2025, 14:26:37**: No functional code changes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
- **Active Refinement of Detail View:** The `detail/index.jsx` file shows frequent, sometimes rapidly reverted, changes, indicating an iterative development process focusing on data loading, state management, and interaction logic for the content detail page.
- **External Content Feature Development:** The introduction of `useExternalEmission` and updates to `externalContentModal` suggest ongoing work on integrating and displaying external content or live event information.
- **Debugging and Code Clarity:** The temporary addition of `console.log` statements and the frequent, small adjustments (including reverts) point to active debugging and attempts to clarify or optimize conditional logic.
- **API Integration and Data Flow:** A central theme across `index.jsx` is the robust integration with various API endpoints (`ApiSeries`, `ApiMedia`, `ApiGetWatchInProgress`, etc.) and careful management of the data flow and loading states.
- **Navigation and Focus Management:** Explicit attention is given to navigation focus within the `SeriesDetail` component, especially as new content sections (like clips, audio, video) are handled.

## 9:12:47
The changes primarily focus on refining the `SeriesDetail` React component's data handling, making minor adjustments to a CSS modal, and debugging/correcting a timestamp formatting utility and its associated hook.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss`** (Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 10:53:52 and 11:26:25)
    *   The platform logo image (`.platformLogoImg`) within the external content modal was updated to include a `max-width: 130px;`, ensuring its size is constrained. This was the only change to this file across the logs.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\detail\index.jsx`** (Timestamps: 10/12/2025, 17:43:44 through 12/12/2025, 14:26:37)
    *   This file, representing the `SeriesDetail` React component, underwent numerous iterative changes, particularly on December 12th.
    *   **Initial Structure (10/12/2025):** The component was introduced with extensive state management (`useState`), effect handling (`useEffect`), API integration (`ApiSetFavorite`, `ApiRemoveFavorite`, `ApiSeries`, `ApiMedia`, `ApiSeasons`, `ApiExtres`, `ApiClips`, `ApiRelated`, `ApiGetWatchInProgress`, `ApiRemoveWatchInProgress`), and context consumption (authentication, parental control, sitecatalyst). It supports both series and media detail pages and handles watch-in-progress data, related content, and various content sections (clips, extras, audios, videos, seasons).
    *   **`handleMediaData` Refinements (12/12/2025):** Several adjustments were made to the `handleMediaData` function, which processes media-specific API responses. These included:
        *   Moving the `mediaData.menu` assignment within the `ApiSeries` callback to ensure it's set correctly, irrespective of the presence of seasons (changes around 13:36:02 and 14:14:44).
        *   A temporary addition and subsequent removal of an `else` block for handling `seasonData` without seasons (13:42:30, reverted by 13:44:16).
        *   Temporarily commenting out and then uncommenting `setCollectionData(mediaData);` at the start of the `handleMediaData` function (13:43:02 and its revert).
        *   Modifying the condition for season checks from `seasonData.seasons?.length > 0` to `seasonData.season_count > 0` and then reverting it back (`13:59:37` and `14:03:46`), indicating a clarification of the data structure.
        *   Adding `loadExtres` specifically when `mediaData.media_type === 'video'` within the `ApiSeries` callback (`14:18:16`), suggesting that extras are now only relevant for video content within this context.
        *   Briefly commenting out and then uncommenting `setIsLoadding(false);` at the end of the `ApiSeries` callback (`14:21:46` and `14:22:00`), possibly for debugging loading states.
    *   **Navigation and Focus (12/12/2025, 13:59:37):** Previously commented-out logic for managing focus (`nav.focus1stElementInContainer`, `nav.resetSelectedElementScrollTop`) for 'VIDEOS', 'AUDIOS', 'SEASONS', and 'CLIPS' sections was activated, indicating work on UI interaction and accessibility.
    *   **Typo Correction (12/12/2025, 13:56:02):** A typo in the import path for `SimplePlayer` was corrected from `simplesPlayer` to `simplePlayer`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useExternalEmission.jsx`** (Timestamps: 11/12/2025, 11:56:30 through 12:15:39)
    *   **Initial Logic (11/12/2025, 11:56:30):** Introduced a `useExternalEmission` hook to determine if an event is live or upcoming, formatting the start date for upcoming events. It converts timestamps (expected in seconds) to milliseconds by multiplying by 1000.
    *   **Debugging and Correction (11/12/2025, 12:04:57 and 12:13:27 - 12:15:39):** Debugging `console.log` statements were added. There was a brief attempt to pass `dates.event_start_emission * 1000` to `formatExternalEmissionDate` at `12:13:27`, which was quickly reverted in subsequent commits (`12:14:06`, `12:15:39`). This indicates the realization that the `formatExternalEmissionDate` utility already handles the conversion from seconds to milliseconds internally, making an additional multiplication in the hook redundant and incorrect.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\utils\time.js`** (Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 12:14:15)
    *   This log entry shows the content of a utility file containing various date and time formatting functions. Critically, the `formatExternalEmissionDate` function, used by `useExternalEmission.jsx`, internally multiplies its `timestampInMs` argument by `1000`, confirming it expects the input timestamp to be in seconds. This context explains the changes observed in `useExternalEmission.jsx`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/12/2025:** Initial major code drop for `SeriesDetail` component and a minor CSS fix.
*   **11/12/2025 (late morning):** Focused debugging and a brief, erroneous modification (and subsequent revert) regarding timestamp conversion in `useExternalEmission.jsx`, informed by the `time.js` utility.
*   **12/12/2025 (afternoon):** Intensive, iterative development and refinement within the `SeriesDetail` component (`index.jsx`), involving API response handling, UI logic activation, and a typo correction. The frequency of commits suggests rapid development and testing.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Refinement:** The `index.jsx` file demonstrates a pattern of rapid, iterative changes, often involving minor adjustments to conditional logic, variable assignments, and loading states within API callbacks. This suggests a process of fine-tuning behavior, possibly in response to testing or evolving API data structures.
*   **Timestamp Conversion Issues:** The `useExternalEmission.jsx` and `time.js` logs highlight a common programming pitfall: confusion or miscommunication about time unit expectations (seconds vs. milliseconds) in API responses or utility functions. The debugging `console.log`s and the quick revert of the `* 1000` multiplication are clear indicators of identifying and correcting such an issue.
*   **Focus on Detail Pages:** A large portion of the changes (in `index.jsx`) are dedicated to the "Detail" view for media content, implying active development in displaying and managing information for individual series or media items, including playback progress, related content, and various content types (audios, videos, clips, extras).

## 10:12:43
Changes spanning from December 10th to December 15th, 2025, primarily focus on enhancing the `SeriesDetail` view, refining external content modal styling, and debugging date formatting for external emissions.

For `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss`:
-   On **December 10, 2025, at 11:26:25**, a styling update was introduced to the `.platformLogoImg` element within the `externalContentModal`. A `max-width: 130px;` property was added to constrain the size of platform logos.

For `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\utils\time.js`:
-   On **December 11, 2025, at 12:14:15**, a new utility function, `formatExternalEmissionDate`, was added. This function formats a timestamp (expected in seconds, but internally multiplied by 1000 for JavaScript's `Date` constructor which expects milliseconds) into a user-friendly Catalan string, displaying the weekday, day, and time. This new utility is directly consumed by the `useExternalEmission` hook.

For `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useExternalEmission.jsx`:
-   Across several timestamps on **December 11, 2025 (11:56:30, 12:04:57, 12:13:27, 12:14:06, 12:15:39)**, the `useExternalEmission` hook underwent iterative development and debugging.
    -   The initial version correctly calculated `isLiveExternal` and `whiteTagText` based on emission start/end dates.
    -   Debugging `console.log` statements were temporarily added (at **12:04:57**) to inspect `startEmission`, `endEmission`, and `nowUTC`.
    -   An attempt was made (at **12:13:27**) to multiply `dates.event_start_emission` by `1000` before passing it to `formatExternalEmissionDate`, likely to address a timestamp unit mismatch, but this was quickly reverted (at **12:14:06**), indicating that the `formatExternalEmissionDate` function itself handles the conversion from seconds to milliseconds. The final state of the hook passes `dates.event_start_emission` as is, relying on the utility function to perform the necessary multiplication.

For `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\detail\index.jsx`:
-   A series of detailed refinements were made to the `SeriesDetail` component.
    -   Initially, on **December 10, 2025, at 17:43:44**, the component showed a comprehensive structure for displaying media and series details, including API calls for favorites, content, watch in progress, and various data sections (seasons, clips, extras, related content). It manages extensive state variables and initializes global `AppGlobal.Detail` properties.
    -   On **December 12, 2025, at 13:36:02**, the assignment of `mediaData.menu` was adjusted within the `handleMediaData` function, moving it outside an `if (seasonData.seasons?.length > 0)` block to ensure it's always set regardless of season presence.
    -   Further changes on **December 12, 2025, at 13:42:30**, added an `else` block to handle cases where no seasons are found, ensuring `mediaData.menu` is still set and `setCollectionData` is called. A subsequent change at **13:43:02** temporarily commented out `setCollectionData(mediaData);` in this `else` block, only to be reverted at **13:44:16**.
    -   At **13:56:02**, a minor path correction was made, changing `simplesPlayer` to `simplePlayer` in an import statement.
    -   Significant updates to UI navigation logic occurred at **13:59:37**, where previously commented-out `focusResults()` calls for `VIDEOS`, `AUDIOS`, `SEASONS` sections were enabled. Additionally, `nav.memory.setGroupLastFocusedID` and `nav.resetSelectedElementScrollTop` calls for the `CLIPS` section were uncommented, activating navigation focus management for these sections.
    -   Between **14:03:46** and **14:04:48**, there was a brief change and reversion in `handleMediaData` regarding the condition to check for seasons, oscillating between `seasonData.season_count > 0` and `seasonData.seasons?.length > 0`.
    -   At **14:14:44**, the `loadClips` call was de-nested from the `if (seasonData.seasons?.length > 0)` block, making it dependent only on `mediaData.media_type === 'video'`.
    -   At **14:18:16**, the `loadExtres` function call was added to the `if (mediaData.media_type === 'video')` block within `handleMediaData`, ensuring both clips and extras are loaded for video media types.
    -   A temporary commenting out and subsequent un-commenting of `setIsLoadding(false);` within `handleMediaData` occurred at **14:21:46** and **14:22:00**, suggesting a quick test or debugging step related to loading state.
    -   Finally, at **14:26:37**, the `case 'EXTRES':` block in the navigation `useEffect` was uncommented, indicating the intention to implement similar focus logic for extras.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
-   **Iterative Debugging:** Multiple small changes, often followed by reverts or minor adjustments (especially for date formatting and `setIsLoadding` calls), indicate an active debugging and refinement process.
-   **Focus on Detail Pages:** The majority of changes are concentrated on the `SeriesDetail` component, addressing data loading, state management, and navigation aspects for rich content pages.
-   **Date/Time Handling:** A specific pattern emerged around ensuring correct timestamp units (seconds vs. milliseconds) for date formatting, highlighting a common challenge in data integration.
-   **Navigation Refinement:** Activation of previously commented-out navigation logic for various content sections suggests ongoing development of the user interface's focus management.
