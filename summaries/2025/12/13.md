# Activity Summary for 13/12/2025

## 0:21:20
The code changes primarily focus on refining the `SeriesDetail` component in `index.jsx` and the `useExternalEmission` hook, along with its related utility function `formatExternalEmissionDate` in `time.js`. A style update was also made to an external content modal.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 10:53:52** - Initial styling was defined for an external content modal, including layout, sizing, colors, and font properties for elements like the overlay, popup, image container, and text rows. A notable recurring element in this initial commit was a duplicated `box-sizing: border-box;` property for `.externalPopup`.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 11:26:25** - A `max-width: 130px;` property was added to `.platformLogoImg`, likely to constrain the size of platform logos displayed within the modal. The duplicate `box-sizing` remained.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\detail\index.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 17:43:44** - This commit introduced a comprehensive `SeriesDetail` React component. It includes extensive state management for API data, content types (series vs. media), loading states, and user interaction (favorites, parental control). It defines functions for loading various content data (series, media, seasons, clips, extres, related content, watch-in-progress data) and updating episodes with watch progress. An import statement for `SimplePlayer` contained a typo (`simplesPlayer`).
    *   **Timestamp: 12/12/2025, 13:36:02** - The logic within `handleMediaData` was adjusted; `mediaData.menu = seasonData.menu;` was moved to be set unconditionally outside the `if (seasonData.seasons?.length > 0)` block when handling clips or episodes.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/12/2025, 13:42:30** - Further modifications to `handleMediaData` included adding an `else` block to handle cases where no seasons are found, ensuring `mediaData.menu` and `setCollectionData` are still updated.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/12/2025, 13:43:02** - The initial `setCollectionData(mediaData);` call within `handleMediaData`'s `try` block was commented out, potentially altering the timing of data display.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/12/2025, 13:44:16** - The changes from 13:42:30 and 13:43:02 were reverted, restoring the code to a state similar to 13:36:02.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/12/2025, 13:56:02** - A typo in the `SimplePlayer` import was corrected from `simplesPlayer` to `simplePlayer`.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/12/2025, 13:59:37** - Navigation focus logic within a `useEffect` was uncommented and activated for 'VIDEOS', 'AUDIOS', 'SEASONS', and 'CLIPS' sections, indicating development in UI focus management.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/12/2025, 14:03:46** - The condition `if (seasonData.seasons?.length > 0)` in `handleMediaData` was temporarily changed to `if (seasonData.season_count > 0)`, likely for testing a different data property.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/12/2025, 14:04:48** - The change at 14:03:46 was reverted, restoring the condition to `if (seasonData.seasons?.length > 0)`.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/12/2025, 14:14:44** - The assignment of `mediaData.menu = seasonData.menu;` and the conditional `loadClips` call were moved out of the `if (seasonData.seasons?.length > 0)` block in `handleMediaData`.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/12/2025, 14:18:16** - `loadExtres` was added to be called for `video` media types within `handleMediaData`'s `ApiSeries` callback, alongside `loadClips`.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/12/2025, 14:21:46** - The `setIsLoadding(false);` call within `handleMediaData`'s `ApiSeries` callback was commented out.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/12/2025, 14:22:00** - The `setIsLoadding(false);` call commented out at 14:21:46 was restored.
    *   **Timestamps 12/12/2025, 13:37:23, 14:15:45, 14:26:37** - These entries for `index.jsx` show no functional changes from their immediate predecessors, indicating re-saves or minor unlogged edits.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useExternalEmission.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 11:56:30** - The `useExternalEmission` hook was defined to determine if an external emission is live or upcoming, using `event_start_emission` and `event_end_emission` from `dates` to calculate `isLiveExternal` and `whiteTagText`.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 12:04:57** - Debugging `console.log` statements were added to output `startEmission`, `endEmission`, and `nowUTC`.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 12:13:27** - The `formatExternalEmissionDate` call for future emissions was modified, multiplying `dates.event_start_emission` by `1000`, suggesting a change in expectation for the unit of `event_start_emission` (from milliseconds to seconds, before `formatExternalEmissionDate` internally multiplies by 1000 again).
    *   **Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 12:14:06** - The modification from 12:13:27 was reverted, removing the `* 1000` from the `formatExternalEmissionDate` argument.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 12:15:39** - No functional change from the previous timestamp, likely a re-save.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\utils\time.js`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 12:14:15** - This file provides various date and time utility functions. The `formatExternalEmissionDate` function, relevant to `useExternalEmission`, was updated or confirmed to internally multiply its `timestampInMs` argument by `1000`, implying that the input to this function is expected in *seconds* despite the parameter name.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Refinement of Media Detail Logic:** The `SeriesDetail` component (`index.jsx`) shows an ongoing pattern of fine-tuning how different content types (series, media, clips, episodes, extres) are loaded and presented, with several quick reverts and adjustments to conditional logic and state updates. This suggests an iterative development process for handling complex media data.
*   **Debugging Practices:** The presence and subsequent removal or reversion of `console.log` statements in `useExternalEmission.jsx` highlights a recurring pattern of adding debugging output during active development or troubleshooting.
*   **Timestamp Unit Ambiguity/Correction:** The `useExternalEmission` hook and `formatExternalEmissionDate` function reveal a point of confusion or correction regarding whether `event_start_emission` is in seconds or milliseconds, with the `formatExternalEmissionDate` function itself implicitly expecting seconds (by multiplying by 1000 internally). The multiple commits around this suggest an active resolution of this potential unit mismatch.
*   **Minor Code Housekeeping:** A typo correction (`simplesPlayer` to `simplePlayer`) and several instances of non-functional saves (identical code between timestamps) indicate general code maintenance and frequent saving during development.
