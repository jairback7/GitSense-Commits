## 9:41:26
The changes log details updates across several files related to a Smart TV application, focusing on UI styling, media detail page logic, and a custom React hook for external emissions.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 10:53:52** - Initial implementation of styling for an `externalContentModal`. This includes general overlay, popup container, and specific left/right sections for content display, promo text, platform information, and action buttons. Styles define fixed positioning, flexbox layouts, dimensions, background colors, border-radius, box-shadows, padding, and font properties.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 11:26:25** - A minor adjustment was made to the `platformLogoImg` within the modal, adding a `max-width` of `130px` to constrain its size.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\detail\index.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 17:43:44** - A significant initial commit for the `SeriesDetail` component, responsible for displaying detailed information about series or media. It imports numerous React hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`, `useRef`), API functions for favorites, series, seasons, clips, extres, related content, media, and watch-in-progress data. The component integrates various UI components, contexts (authentication, parental control, sitecatalyst), and utility functions. It initializes multiple state variables for data, error handling, current section, season, related items, and loading status. Core functionality includes `handleSeriesData`, `handleMediaData` for fetching content, and `loadAudioVideo`, `loadSeasonChapters`, `loadExtres`, `loadClips`, `loadRelated`, `loadWatchInProgressData` for subsequent data loading. Navigation focus logic for different content sections was present but largely commented out.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/12/2025, 13:36:02** - Modified `handleMediaData` to ensure `mediaData.menu` is updated from `seasonData.menu` even when `seasonData.seasons` might be empty.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/12/2025, 13:42:30** - Further refinement in `handleMediaData` added an `else` block to explicitly set `mediaData.menu` and `setCollectionData` when no seasons are found.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/12/2025, 13:43:02 & 13:44:16** - These timestamps show a temporary addition and subsequent removal of `setCollectionData(mediaData)` within the `else` block of `handleMediaData`, suggesting an iterative process of refining how media data is updated, eventually reverting to an earlier state for `setCollectionData` but keeping `mediaData.menu` assignment.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/12/2025, 13:56:02** - Corrected a typo in an import statement: `SimplePlayer from '@/components/simplesPlayer'` was changed to `SimplePlayer from '@/components/simplePlayer'`.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/12/2025, 13:59:37** - Uncommented and activated navigation focus logic for 'VIDEOS', 'AUDIOS', and 'SEASONS' sections, and also added scroll reset and focus for 'CLIPS'.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/12/2025, 14:03:46 & 14:04:48** - Brief change and reversion in `handleMediaData`, switching the season check from `seasonData.seasons?.length > 0` to `seasonData.season_count > 0` and back, indicating a test or consideration of alternative season count properties.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/12/2025, 14:14:44** - Refactored `handleMediaData` to move the assignment of `mediaData.menu` and the `loadClips` call (for video media types) outside the `if (seasonData.seasons?.length > 0)` block, ensuring these actions occur regardless of the presence of seasons.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/12/2025, 14:18:16** - Added `loadExtres` call within the `if (mediaData.media_type === 'video')` block in `handleMediaData`, alongside `loadClips`.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/12/2025, 14:21:46 & 14:22:00** - Temporarily commented out and then uncommented `setIsLoadding(false)` within `handleMediaData`'s `ApiSeries` success callback, likely for debugging loading states.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/12/2025, 14:26:37 & 15/12/2025, 9:36:00** - No discernible functional changes in the provided code snippets.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useExternalEmission.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 11:56:30** - Introduced `useExternalEmission` hook. This hook uses `useMemo` to determine if an external emission is live or scheduled, based on `event_start_emission` and `event_end_emission` dates. It calculates `isLiveExternal` and generates `whiteTagText` using `formatExternalEmissionDate` if the event is in the future.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 12:04:57** - Added `console.log` statements for debugging `startEmission`, `endEmission`, and `nowUTC` values.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 12:13:27** - Modified the `formatExternalEmissionDate` call to explicitly multiply `dates.event_start_emission` by `1000`, suggesting a need to convert seconds to milliseconds for the formatting function.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 12:14:06** - Reverted the previous change, removing the `* 1000` multiplier from the `formatExternalEmissionDate` argument.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\utils\time.js`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/12/2025, 12:14:15** - Added the `formatExternalEmissionDate` utility function. This function takes a timestamp in milliseconds and formats it into a human-readable string, including the capitalized weekday, day number, and time (e.g., "DILLUNS 25 | 10.30"). This function is crucial for the `useExternalEmission` hook.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Refinement and Debugging:** Many commits show small, quick changes, often followed by reverts or further adjustments, particularly in `index.jsx` and `useExternalEmission.jsx`. The presence of `console.log` statements and their subsequent removal or changes to loading states points to active debugging and incremental development.
*   **Data Handling and API Integration:** The `SeriesDetail` component heavily relies on various API calls (`ApiSeries`, `ApiMedia`, `ApiSeasons`, `ApiExtres`, `ApiClips`, `ApiRelated`, `ApiGetWatchInProgress`) and complex data processing logic (`formatChapters`, `getUpdatedDefaultEpisode`). There's a recurring need to ensure all relevant data (seasons, menu, watch progress, clips, extres) is correctly loaded and processed for different media types (series, media, clips, episodes).
*   **Timestamp Unit Consistency:** The `useExternalEmission.jsx` hook and `time.js` utility show a pattern of careful handling of timestamp units, specifically around converting between seconds and milliseconds (`* 1000`), indicating a potential source of errors or a precise requirement for time representation.
*   **UI/UX Enhancements:** Minor styling updates in `styles.scss` (e.g., `max-width` for logos) and the activation of navigation focus logic in `index.jsx` indicate ongoing work to improve the visual presentation and user interaction.
*   **State Management:** Extensive use of `useState` and `useRef` hooks across the `SeriesDetail` component for managing various pieces of application state, reflecting a React-centric development approach.
