# Activity Summary for 11/12/2025

## 3:36:06
The `externalContentModal\styles.scss` file underwent two updates on 10/12/2025. The initial commit at 10:53:52 established the comprehensive styling for an `externalModalOverlay`. This included a fixed, semi-transparent dark background, a rounded `externalPopup` with a dark background and shadow, and distinct `popupLeft` and `popupRight` sections. The `popupLeft` section was designed for displaying images and a platform logo at the bottom, while `popupRight` handled promotional and platform-specific text rows, both featuring `infoImg` elements, and a `popupButtons` container. A minor update at 11:26:25 added a `max-width: 130px;` property to the `.platformLogoImg` within the `platformLogoContainer`, likely to constrain the size of the platform logo. Both versions of the file contained a duplicate `box-sizing: border-box;` declaration within `.externalPopup`.

The `detail\index.jsx` file, updated on 10/12/2025, 17:43:44, represents a significant development for a `SeriesDetail` React component. This component is responsible for displaying detailed information for both series and individual media items. Key features include:

*   **Extensive Imports:** A wide array of React hooks, API calls (for favorites, series, seasons, media, extras, clips, related content, and watch-in-progress), UI components (spinners, buttons, modals, image cropping, media info, player components, parental control), navigation utilities, data handlers, and context providers are imported.
*   **State and Context Management:** The component leverages numerous `useState` hooks to manage data, loading states, errors, current sections (default, audios, videos, seasons, clips, extras), and user interactions. It also integrates `useRef` for tracking loaded states and component references. `useAuthContext`, `useParentalControlContext`, and `useSitecatalyst` are used for application-wide concerns like authentication, parental controls, and analytics tracking.
*   **API Interaction and Data Handling:** It defines a series of asynchronous functions (`handleSeriesData`, `handleMediaData`, `loadContentData`, `loadAudioVideo`, `loadSeasonChapters`, `loadExtres`, `loadClips`, `loadRelated`, `loadWatchInProgressData`, `getUpdatedDefaultEpisode`) to fetch and process data from various backend endpoints, including logic to determine the default episode and integrate watch-in-progress data.
*   **Dynamic Content Display:** Logic is in place to conditionally load and display episodes, clips, extras, audios, and videos based on the `currentSection`. It also formats chapter data and applies user watch progress.
*   **Localization:** The `useText` hook is consistently used to fetch localized text strings, indicating multi-language support.
*   **Navigation and Focus:** `useEffect` hooks manage initial data loading, component initialization (`init` function triggered by `contentId` changes), and navigation/focusing behavior, particularly for elements within related content and clip sections, suggesting an application designed for keyboard/remote control interaction.
*   **Global State Integration:** The component frequently interacts with a `window.AppGlobal` object to store and retrieve global application state, such as `watchInProgressData` and `Detail`-specific functions and data.
*   **Styling:** It imports two SCSS files: `styles.scss` and `styles.kids.scss`, suggesting potentially distinct styling for different user profiles or content types.

The changes log details updates across styling and a major React component for content detail views.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 10:53:52**
        Initial styling for an `externalModalOverlay`. This SCSS defines a fixed-position overlay with a dark background, containing an `externalPopup`. The popup is structured with a `popupLeft` section (for an image and a platform logo container at the bottom) and a `popupRight` section (for promotional text, platform-specific text, and buttons). It includes detailed flexbox layouts, specific dimensions, colors, fonts (`Bw 3Cat`), and shadow effects.
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 11:26:25**
        A minor but specific update was made to the `.platformLogoContainer .platformLogoImg` selector, adding `max-width: 130px;`. This change ensures that platform logos within the modal do not exceed a certain width, maintaining layout consistency.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\detail\index.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 10/12/2025, 17:43:44**
        This entry reflects a comprehensive update to the `SeriesDetail` React component, which handles the display of detailed information for series or individual media items.
        *   **Imports and Dependencies:** Significant additions include `SimplePlayer`, `MEDIA_TYPES` (from `./constants`), and helpers like `getImage`, `getProgressPercentage`, `getMainActionButtonConfig` (from `./helpers`). There are also new imports for `SeasonChaptersInfinite` and several API calls (`ApiSetFavorite`, `ApiRemoveFavorite`, `ApiSeries`, `ApiSeasons`, `ApiExtres`, `ApiClips`, `ApiRelated`, `ApiMedia`, `ApiGetWatchInProgress`, `ApiRemoveWatchInProgress`). Contexts for authentication (`useAuthContext`), parental control (`useParentalControlContext`), and analytics (`useSitecatalyst`) are now integrated.
        *   **State Management:** The component uses a wide array of `useState` hooks to manage data such as `apiData`, `errorStatus`, `currentSection`, `currentSeason`, `itemOver`, `clipsData`, `episodes`, `extresData`, `relatedData`, `isArchived`, `filteredAudiosData`, `filteredVideosData`, `contentToPlay`, `isLoadding`, `isFavorite`, `isLicensed`, and `userModalType`. `useRef` hooks are used for `clipsLoaded`, `capitols`, and `infoGroupRef`.
        *   **Data Handling and API Interactions:**
            *   Functions like `handleSeriesData` and `handleMediaData` are central to processing fetched content, including license checks, integrating watch-in-progress data, and determining default episodes.
            *   `loadContentData` orchestrates the fetching based on `detailPageType` (series or media).
            *   Dedicated functions (`loadAudioVideo`, `loadSeasonChapters`, `loadExtres`, `loadClips`, `loadRelated`) manage specific content types, often formatting data before updating state.
            *   Extensive logic is present for handling "watch in progress" data, including archiving and retrieving the most relevant episode.
        *   **User Experience and Features:**
            *   Integration with `useText` indicates support for localization of UI strings.
            *   `ParentalControl` and `UserModal` components are utilized, with handlers for sign-in, registration, and guest access.
            *   The component supports various content sections (`DEFAULT`, `AUDIOS`, `VIDEOS`, `SEASONS`, `CLIPS`, `EXTRES`), with logic to load appropriate data.
            *   Focus management (e.g., `nav.focus1stElementInContainer`, `nav.memory.setGroupLastFocusedID`) is implemented, suggesting optimization for remote control navigation.
        *   **Lifecycle Management:** The `init` `useEffect` now correctly re-runs when `contentId` changes, ensuring fresh data for different content. Other effects manage data loading status and focus.
        *   **Styling:** Imports `styles.scss` and `styles.kids.scss`, indicating separate styling for a children-friendly interface.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**

*   **10/12/2025, 11:26:25:** A focused style adjustment to platform logo images within a modal.
*   **10/12/2025, 17:43:44:** A major overhaul and feature addition to the `SeriesDetail` component, including new player integration, extensive API calls, enhanced state management, and context integration.

**Patterns or recurring elements in the content:**

*   **Consistent File Path Structure:** All files are located within the `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\` directory, indicating a structured project.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The use of `components`, `modals`, and `views` directories suggests a React application adhering to a component-driven design.
*   **API Service Layer:** Frequent imports and calls to `../../api_v2/` modules (`ApiSetFavorite`, `ApiSeries`, `ApiMedia`, etc.) demonstrate a dedicated API interaction layer.
*   **Extensive State Management:** The `index.jsx` file heavily relies on React's `useState` and `useRef` hooks for managing a large amount of dynamic data and UI state, a common pattern in complex React applications.
*   **Context API Usage:** The `index.jsx` component utilizes `useAuthContext`, `useParentalControlContext`, and `useSitecatalyst` for global state management and cross-component data sharing, suggesting an application-wide strategy for authentication, parental controls, and analytics.
*   **Focus Management:** The presence of `nav.focus1stElementInContainer` and `nav.memory.setGroupLastFocusedID` in `index.jsx` indicates an application designed for smart TV environments where navigation often involves directional input and explicit focus management.
