# Activity Summary for 11/12/2025

## 3:36:06
The `externalContentModal\styles.scss` file underwent two updates on 10/12/2025. The initial commit at 10:53:52 established the comprehensive styling for an `externalModalOverlay`. This included a fixed, semi-transparent dark background, a rounded `externalPopup` with a dark background and shadow, and distinct `popupLeft` and `popupRight` sections. The `popupLeft` section was designed for displaying images and a platform logo at the bottom, while `popupRight` handled promotional and platform-specific text rows, both featuring `infoImg` elements, and a `popupButtons` container. A minor update at 11:26:25 added a `max-width: 130px;` property to the `.platformLogoImg` within the `platformLogoContainer`, likely to constrain the size of the platform logo. Both versions of the file contained a duplicate `box-sizing: border-box;` declaration within `.externalPopup`.

The `detail\index.jsx` file, updated on 10/12/2025, 17:43:44, represents a significant development for a `SeriesDetail` React component. This component is responsible for displaying detailed information for both series and individual media items. Key features include:

*   **Extensive Imports:** A wide array of React hooks, API calls (for favorites, series, seasons, media, extras, clips, related content, and watch-in-progress), UI components (spinners, buttons, modals, image cropping, media info, player components, parental control), navigation utilities, data handlers, and context providers are imported.
*   **State and Context Management:** The component leverages numerous `useState` hooks to manage data, loading states, errors, current sections (default, audios, videos, seasons, clips, extras), and user interactions. It also integrates `useRef` for tracking loaded states and component references. `useAuthContext`, `useParentalControlContext`, and `useSitecatalyst` are used for application-wide concerns like authentication, parental controls, and analytics tracking.
*   **API Interaction and Data Handling:** It defines a series of asynchronous functions (`handleSeriesData`, `handleMediaData`, `loadContentData`, `loadAudioVideo`, `loadSeasonChapters`, `loadExtres`, `loadClips`, `loadRelated`, `loadWatchInProgressData`, `getUpdatedDefaultEpisode`) to fetch and process data from various backend endpoints, including logic to determine the default episode and integrate watch-in-progress data.
*   **Dynamic Content Display:** Logic is in place to conditionally load and display episodes, clips, extras, audios, and videos based on the `currentSection`. It also formats chapter data and applies user watch progress.
*   **Localization:** The `useText` hook is consistently used to fetch localized text strings, indicating multi-language support.
*   **Navigation and Focus:** `useEffect` hooks manage initial data loading, component initialization (`init` function triggered by `contentId` changes), and navigation/focusing behavior, particularly for elements within related content and clip sections, suggesting an application designed for keyboard/remote control interaction.
*   **Global State Integration:** The component frequently interacts with a `window.AppGlobal` object to store and retrieve global application state, such as `watchInProgressData` and `Detail`-specific functions and data.
*   **Styling:** It imports two SCSS files: `styles.scss` and `styles.kids.scss`, suggesting potentially distinct styling for different user profiles or content types.
