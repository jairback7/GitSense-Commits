# Activity Summary for 7/12/2025

## 4:11:31
The log details two consecutive updates to the `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\detail\index.jsx` file.

The first change, timestamped 5/12/2025, 9:30:47, shows the file's state at that moment.

The second change, timestamped 5/12/2025, 9:31:26, occurred less than a minute after the first. The only modification identified is within the `handleMediaData` asynchronous function, specifically inside the success callback of the `ApiSeries` call. The line `mediaData.menu = seasonData.menu;` was commented out, changing it to `//mediaData.menu = seasonData.menu;`.

This indicates a minor adjustment to how `mediaData.menu` was being assigned or processed, possibly to debug an issue or remove an unnecessary data assignment. The rapid succession of timestamps suggests a quick, focused code edit or hotfix.
