The provided log details changes to a single file, `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss`**
    *   **Initial State (10/12/2025, 10:53:52):** This stylesheet defines the visual appearance for an `externalContentModal`. It includes styles for an `externalModalOverlay` (fixed, full-screen, semi-transparent background, high z-index), an `externalPopup` (a central, rounded, shadowed container with a dark background), and its internal layout. The popup is split into `popupLeft` (displaying an image and a platform logo container) and `popupRight` (containing promotional text, platform information, and action buttons). Specific dimensions, padding, colors (dark greys, black, white), and font styles (using "Bw 3Cat") are set for various elements like `popupImage`, `platformLogoContainer`, `promoTextRow`, `platformTextRow`, and their respective text and image components.
    *   **Update (10/12/2025, 11:26:25):** A specific change was introduced to the `platformLogoImg` element within the `platformLogoContainer`. The property `max-width: 130px;` was added, likely to ensure that platform logos displayed in the modal do not exceed a certain width, maintaining a consistent layout. All other styles remained identical to the previous version.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
The primary styling for the modal was established at 10/12/2025, 10:53:52. A minor refinement to image sizing within the modal occurred shortly after, at 10/12/2025, 11:26:25.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**
*   **Flexbox for Layout:** `display: flex` is extensively used across many components (`externalModalOverlay`, `externalPopup`, `popupLeft`, `popupRight`, `promoTextRow`, `platformTextRow`, `popupButtons`, `platformLogoContainer`, `platformTextWrapper`) for flexible and responsive positioning of elements.
*   **Consistent Color Palette:** The styles primarily use a dark theme, with shades of black (`#000`), dark grey (`#222`, `#272525`, `#333`), and a semi-transparent dark overlay (`rgba(17, 17, 17, 0.85)`), contrasted with white text (`#fff`).
*   **Specific Font Usage:** The "Bw 3Cat" font is consistently applied to `popupPromo` and `popupPlatform` text elements within the modal, indicating a brand-specific font choice.
*   **Standardized Image Containers:** Both `promoTextRow` and `platformTextRow` utilize a similar `infoImg` structure with fixed width/height and `overflow: hidden` for housing small icon images.
*   **Modal Structure:** There's a clear hierarchical structure for the modal: overlay -> main popup -> left/right content sections.
