# Activity Summary for 10/12/2025

## 11:43:23
The provided log details changes to a single file, `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss`**
    *   **Initial State (10/12/2025, 10:53:52):** This stylesheet defines the visual appearance for an `externalContentModal`. It includes styles for an `externalModalOverlay` (fixed, full-screen, semi-transparent background, high z-index), an `externalPopup` (a central, rounded, shadowed container with a dark background), and its internal layout. The popup is split into `popupLeft` (displaying an image and a platform logo container) and `popupRight` (containing promotional text, platform information, and action buttons). Specific dimensions, padding, colors (dark greys, black, white), and font styles (using "Bw 3Cat") are set for various elements like `popupImage`, `platformLogoContainer`, `promoTextRow`, `platformTextRow`, and their respective text and image components.
    *   **Update (10/12/2025, 11:26:25):** A specific change was introduced to the `platformLogoImg` element within the `platformLogoContainer`. The property `max-width: 130px;` was added, likely to ensure that platform logos displayed in the modal do not exceed a certain width, maintaining a consistent layout. All other styles remained identical to the previous version.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
The primary styling for the modal was established at 10/12/2025, 10:53:52. A minor refinement to image sizing within the modal occurred shortly after, at 10/12/2025, 11:26:25.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**
*   **Flexbox for Layout:** `display: flex` is extensively used across many components (`externalModalOverlay`, `externalPopup`, `popupLeft`, `popupRight`, `promoTextRow`, `platformTextRow`, `popupButtons`, `platformLogoContainer`, `platformTextWrapper`) for flexible and responsive positioning of elements.
*   **Consistent Color Palette:** The styles primarily use a dark theme, with shades of black (`#000`), dark grey (`#222`, `#272525`, `#333`), and a semi-transparent dark overlay (`rgba(17, 17, 17, 0.85)`), contrasted with white text (`#fff`).
*   **Specific Font Usage:** The "Bw 3Cat" font is consistently applied to `popupPromo` and `popupPlatform` text elements within the modal, indicating a brand-specific font choice.
*   **Standardized Image Containers:** Both `promoTextRow` and `platformTextRow` utilize a similar `infoImg` structure with fixed width/height and `overflow: hidden` for housing small icon images.
*   **Modal Structure:** There's a clear hierarchical structure for the modal: overlay -> main popup -> left/right content sections.

The provided log details changes to a single file: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`styles.scss` (External Content Modal Styling):**
    *   **Initial State (10/12/2025, 10:53:52):** This update established the core styling for an `externalContentModal`. It defined a fixed overlay (`.externalModalOverlay`) with a semi-transparent background. The main modal popup (`.externalPopup`) was structured as a flex row with a specific width, dark background, rounded corners, and shadow.
        *   The popup is divided into a `.popupLeft` section (for an image and platform logo) and a `.popupRight` section (for text and buttons).
        *   Styling for images (`.popupImage`, `.platformLogoImg`) and text containers (`.promoTextRow`, `.platformTextRow`) was included, along with basic button container styling.
        *   A minor pattern observed is the duplication of `box-sizing: border-box;` within the `.externalPopup` rule.
    *   **Subsequent Update (10/12/2025, 11:26:25):** A specific refinement was introduced to the platform logo image. The rule `max-width: 130px;` was added to `.externalPopup .popupLeft .platformLogoContainer .platformLogoImg`, indicating an adjustment to limit the width of the platform logo displayed within the modal.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/12/2025, 10:53:52:** Marks the creation or initial comprehensive styling commit for the `externalContentModal`.
*   **10/12/2025, 11:26:25:** Indicates a quick follow-up modification to refine the `max-width` of a logo image within the same modal component.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   The changes consistently focus on styling definitions (`.scss`) for a specific UI component, an "external content modal."
*   Styling includes common CSS properties for layout (flexbox, positioning), dimensions, colors, typography (e.g., "Bw 3Cat" font-family), and visual effects (box-shadow, border-radius).
*   The use of nested SCSS rules (`.externalModalOverlay .externalPopup .popupLeft`) is prevalent, reflecting a component-based styling approach.
*   Updates are incremental, with later changes refining specific visual details (like `max-width` for an image) rather than overhauling the entire structure.

The log details changes across two distinct files within the `MEDIAPRO/3cat_smarttv` project, all occurring on December 10, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 10/12/2025, 10:53:52 (initial) and 10/12/2025, 11:26:25 (update).
    *   **Description:** This SCSS file defines the styling for an `externalModalOverlay` component.
        *   The initial version established a fixed overlay with dark background, centered content, and styled `externalPopup` with `flex-direction: row`, `border-radius: 40px`, and `box-shadow`. It laid out `popupLeft` (for image and platform logo) and `popupRight` (for promotional text, platform details, and buttons) sections.
        *   A subsequent change at 11:26:25 introduced a `max-width: 130px;` property to the `.platformLogoImg` selector, limiting the maximum width of the platform logos displayed within the modal.

2.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\detail\index.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 10/12/2025, 17:43:44.
    *   **Description:** This log entry represents a comprehensive update to the `SeriesDetail` React component, which appears to be a central view for displaying detailed information about media and series.
        *   **Extensive Imports:** The component imports a wide array of functionalities, including various API calls (for favorites, series, seasons, extras, clips, media, and watch-in-progress data), React hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`, `useRef`), navigation utilities (`useNavigate`, `useParams`), numerous UI components (buttons, modals, spinners, image cropper, info groups, time lines, different item types, parental control, simple player, audio/subtitles config), and several utility helpers (for images, text, favorites memory, user modal handlers). It also integrates with `sitecatalyst`, `authContext`, and `parentalControlContext`.
        *   **State Management:** The component uses `useState` extensively to manage dynamic data such as `apiData`, `errorStatus`, `currentSection`, `currentSeason`, `clipsData`, `episodes`, `extresData`, `relatedData`, `isArchived`, `filteredAudiosData`, `filteredVideosData`, `contentToPlay`, `isLoadding`, `isFavorite`, and `isLicensed`. `useRef` is used for managing references to DOM elements and non-re-rendering values.
        *   **Data Fetching & Processing:** It includes functions like `handleSeriesData`, `handleMediaData`, `loadContentData`, `loadAudioVideo`, `loadSeasonChapters`, `loadExtres`, `loadClips`, `loadRelated`, and `loadWatchInProgressData` to fetch, format, and filter content from various APIs. A key `getUpdatedDefaultEpisode` function determines which episode should be played by default, considering watch-in-progress status.
        *   **Context Integration:** The component actively uses `useAuthContext`, `useParentalControlContext`, and `useSitecatalyst` to manage user authentication, parental control restrictions, and analytics tracking.
        *   **Lifecycle and Effects:** An `init` function orchestrates initial data loading and state setup, triggered by `useEffect` when `contentId` changes. Another `useEffect` handles focus management based on the `currentSection`.
        *   **Styling:** It imports local stylesheets (`./styles.scss` and `./styles.kids.scss`), suggesting distinct styling for different user types or content.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Modular Component Architecture:** The `SeriesDetail` component heavily relies on importing and integrating many smaller, specialized components (e.g., various buttons, modals, and item types), indicating a modular and reusable design approach.
*   **Asynchronous Data Handling:** Extensive use of `async/await` and callback functions for API calls (`ApiSeries`, `ApiMedia`, etc.) with `try-catch` blocks for error management.
*   **State-Driven UI:** The application frequently updates UI elements based on changes in `useState` variables, such as `isLoadding`, `isFavorite`, and `currentSection`.
*   **Global State/Context Management:** The presence of `window.AppGlobal` and the use of React Contexts (`useAuthContext`, `useParentalControlContext`, `useSitecatalyst`) indicate a strategy for managing application-wide state and shared functionalities.
*   **Focus Management:** The `useEffect` block related to `currentSection` and `nav` (presumably a navigation utility) suggests an emphasis on keyboard navigation or focus control, common in smart TV or media applications.
*   **SCSS for Styling:** Both CSS changes are within SCSS files, indicating a preference for pre-processed CSS with nested rules.
*   **Consistency in Naming:** API function names (`ApiSetFavorite`, `ApiSeries`, `ApiExtres`, etc.) follow a clear and consistent pattern.
*   **User Experience Features:** Features like watch-in-progress tracking, parental control, favorites, and dynamic content loading highlight a focus on a rich and personalized user experience.
