# Activity Summary for 9/12/2025

## 1:03:38
The file `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\detail\index.jsx` underwent a minor modification between 5/12/2025, 9:30:47 and 5/12/2025, 9:31:26.

Specifically, in the `handleMediaData` asynchronous function, the line `mediaData.menu = seasonData.menu;` was commented out. This change appears within a callback for the `ApiSeries` call, where season-specific data is processed and assigned to the `mediaData` object if the content is a clip or episode.

The file itself is a React component (`SeriesDetail`) responsible for displaying detailed information about series and media content. It extensively uses React hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`, `useRef`), interacts with various APIs for favorites, series, media, and watch-in-progress data, and incorporates several UI components for navigation, media display, and user interaction (e.g., Parental Control, UserModal, Spinner). It also handles routing parameters (`contetId`), manages different display sections (VIDEOS, AUDIOS, SEASONS, CLIPS, EXTRES, RELATED), and integrates with context providers for authentication and parental control. The `init` effect, now triggered by `contetId` changes, initializes the component by loading content and related data.
