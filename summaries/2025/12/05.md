# Activity Summary for 5/12/2025

## 9:39:55
In `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\detail\index.jsx`, a specific change occurred between 9:30:47 and 9:31:26 on 5/12/2025. The line `mediaData.menu = seasonData.menu;` within the `handleMediaData` asynchronous function was commented out. This indicates a minor refinement, possibly to disable or defer a menu assignment operation when handling media data, particularly for clips or episodes. This was the only modification observed across the two log entries for this file.
