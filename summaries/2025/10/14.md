# Activity Summary for 14/10/2025

## 11:44:29
This log details a series of changes primarily focused on enhancing multi-platform support and a core content display page within a Smart TV application. The changes occurred on **October 14, 2025**, within a concentrated period between 11:14 and 11:40.

**Key File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (11:14:32):**
    *   Introduced `initAppTizen` to initialize Tizen applications, including fetching device model/manufacturer and attaching event listeners.
    *   Configured `visibilitychange` listener to pause playback and navigate back (`history.go(-1)`) when the app is hidden, and resume playback when visible.
    *   Added an `evExitApplication` listener to gracefully exit the Tizen application.
    *   Exported `launchAppTizen` for launching other Tizen applications with custom parameters via `tizen.ApplicationControl`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\webos\webos.js` (11:15:03):**
    *   Implemented `initAppWebos` for WebOS application initialization.
    *   Attached listeners for `webOSLaunch` and `webOSRelaunch` events to handle app state transitions.
    *   Set up a `visibilitychange` listener for WebOS, logging changes and calling `window.AppGlobal.Actions.onVisibilityChange()` when the app becomes visible.
    *   Added an `evExitApplication` listener to close the WebOS application window.
    *   Exported `launchAppWebOS` to launch other WebOS applications using the `luna://com.webos.applicationManager` service.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\platform.js` (Multiple updates):**
    *   **11:15:18:** Initialized a `Platform` object with `initPlatform` (a switch-case to call platform-specific initialization functions like `TizenDevice()` or `WebosDevice()`) and `initKeyboard` (conditional keyboard navigation based on `window.AppGlobal.platform`).
    *   **11:16:42:** **Significant update.** Added a new `launchApp` method to the `Platform` object. This method acts as a central dispatcher for launching applications, invoking `launchAppTizen` or `launchAppWebOS` based on the detected platform, providing a unified API for cross-platform app launching.
    *   **11:33:01:** Modified import statements for `TizenDevice` and `WebosDevice` from named to default exports, indicating a change in how these modules are exported.
    *   **11:40:20:** Refined the `launchApp` method by converting the detected `platform` string to lowercase (`.toLowerCase()`) before the switch-case, ensuring case-insensitive matching for platform identification.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (Multiple entries, effectively one major change):**
    *   **11:28:44, 11:38:35, 11:39:17:** These three entries appear to be identical or very minor changes, possibly repeated saves. The main content describes a comprehensive React `Page` component.
    *   This component manages page data, loading states, and error handling.
    *   It features dynamic content fetching for home pages (`getHomeData`) and specific content pages (`getPageData`), including logic for "ranking" pages.
    *   Crucially, it implements logic for fetching and refreshing "Now Playing" data (`ApiGetNowPlayingSelector`, `ApiGetNowPlaying`) for live streams, including a `setInterval` for continuous updates.
    *   Includes a `filterChildren` function that dynamically filters content rows based on platform capabilities (`isLiveSupported`, `isShakaPlayerSupported`), allowing for conditional rendering (e.g., removing live content if not supported).
    *   Utilizes numerous React hooks (`useEffect`, `useRef`, `useState`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`) for lifecycle management, data persistence, and performance.
    *   Integrates with global `AppGlobal` and navigation systems (`nav`).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platformConfig.js` (11:33:59):**
    *   Defined global `window.AppGlobal` for storing application-wide state (platform, versions, player info, etc.) and `window.PlatformUtils` for utility functions.
    *   `PlatformUtils.getPlatform` was extended to detect various Smart TV platforms (HbbTV, Tizen, WebOS, Hisense, LG) based on the User Agent. For WebOS, it dynamically injects the `webOSTV.js` library.
    *   `PlatformUtils.configurePlatformResolution` dynamically adjusts the UI resolution (720p or 1080p) based on `window.innerWidth` and adds corresponding CSS classes to the `<body>`.
    *   `PlatformUtils.getOSVersion` retrieves the OS version using platform-specific APIs for Tizen and WebOS.
    *   Initializes the global platform and resolution settings on script load.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\portraitItem\index.jsx` (11:35:36):**
    *   A React component `PortraitItem` for displaying content items (like posters) with an image, optional ranking, audio icon, or future date labels.
    *   Integrates with a custom focus management system (`registerFocusAction`, `unregisterFocusAction`) and uses `data-nav-*` attributes for specific navigation behaviors, indicating a custom spatial navigation implementation for TV remote control.
    *   Includes conditional rendering for license status and item type.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Multi-Platform Development:** A strong recurring theme is the abstraction and implementation of functionalities tailored for specific Smart TV platforms (Tizen, WebOS, HbbTV). This is evident in the dedicated platform files and the `platform.js` dispatcher.
*   **Global State and Utilities:** The extensive use of `window.AppGlobal` and `window.PlatformUtils` suggests a centralized approach to application-wide state management and utility functions.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** Frequent use of `document.addEventListener` for various application lifecycle events (visibility changes, exit events, user changes, menu navigation) across different platforms and components.
*   **Dynamic Content and Live Data:** The `Page` component demonstrates a robust system for fetching and dynamically updating content, particularly for live streams, including filtering content based on platform capabilities.
*   **Custom Navigation/Focus System:** The presence of `registerFocusAction`, `unregisterFocusAction`, and various `data-nav-*` attributes in `PortraitItem` points to a custom-built spatial navigation system optimized for TV remote controls, crucial for Smart TV applications.
*   **Modular React Components:** The codebase leverages React for UI development, with components like `Page` and `PortraitItem` encapsulating specific functionalities and rendering logic.
*   **Development Activity:** The clustered timestamps on October 14, 2025, indicate a focused session of development, likely involving implementing new features related to platform compatibility, app launching, and dynamic content handling, or a series of rapid iterations and saves.
