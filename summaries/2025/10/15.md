# Activity Summary for 15/10/2025

## 11:38:10
The `tizen.js` file, timestamped 15/10/2025, 11:30:35, defines core functionalities for a Tizen Smart TV application. It includes `initAppTizen` which initializes the application by retrieving device information (model, manufacturer) and attaching event listeners. Crucially, it handles the application's lifecycle events: `visibilitychange` for pausing/resuming media playback (using `player.pause()` and `webapis.avplay.play()`) and navigating back, and `evExitApplication` for gracefully exiting the Tizen app. The file also provides `launchAppTizen` for launching other Tizen applications, including passing custom data, and `openSamsungStore` to redirect users to the Samsung SmartHub product detail page if an app launch fails or for specific promotions. The `TizenDevice` function primarily serves to kick off `initAppTizen`. This file is critical for platform-specific interactions and lifecycle management on Tizen devices.

The `index.jsx` file, timestamped 15/10/2025, 11:31:02, represents a complex React component responsible for rendering a dynamic content page, likely a home screen or a content category page, within the 3cat Smart TV application. It heavily leverages React hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`, `useRef`, etc.) and several custom hooks (`useFixedFocus`, `useVirtualizedRows`) to manage state, focus, and performance for potentially large lists of content.

Key functionalities include:
*   **Data Fetching**: `getHomeData` fetches personalized home screen data (differentiating for 'kid' profiles) and initiates real-time updates for live content. `getPageData` fetches content for other pages, including logic to identify and enrich "ranking" type pages.
*   **Live Content Management**: A significant portion of the code (`checkTimeFrame`, `mergeData`, `getNowPlayingSelectorData`, `refreshLives`) is dedicated to fetching, updating, and displaying live streaming content, refreshing it at a configurable interval (`live_refresh_interval`).
*   **Content Filtering**: The `filterChildren` function dynamically filters content based on platform capabilities, such as hiding live content or specific rows if live streaming or Shaka Player is not supported, and optimizing slider rendering.
*   **User Experience**: It integrates various UI components (rows, sliders, spinners, modals), handles user authentication status through `useAuthContext`, and manages navigation with `react-router-dom`. Error handling is implemented for API calls, redirecting on unauthorized access or token expiration.
*   **Global State & Events**: The component interacts with `window.AppGlobal` for global actions and listens to custom events like `menu:navigate` and `evChangeUser` to reset its state, indicating tight integration with the application's overall structure and menu system.

Recurring patterns across these changes highlight a multi-platform Smart TV application development approach with a strong focus on:
*   **Platform-specific Adaptations**: Explicit handling for Tizen OS in `tizen.js` and capability checks (`isLiveSupported`, `isShakaPlayerSupported`) in `index.jsx` suggest a robust architecture designed for different device capabilities.
*   **Real-time & Live Content**: Both files show a clear emphasis on supporting and managing live video streams, including their playback control and dynamic data updates.
*   **User-Centric Design**: Features like personalized content (kid profiles), authentication handling, intuitive navigation, and performance optimizations (virtualized rows, fixed focus) point to a focus on a rich user experience.
*   **Robustness**: Extensive error handling and event-driven state management are prevalent, crucial for stable application behavior on Smart TV platforms.
*   **Modularity**: The use of custom hooks, context providers, and separate API handler files indicates a modular codebase.
