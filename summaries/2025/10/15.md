# Activity Summary for 15/10/2025

## 11:38:10
The `tizen.js` file, timestamped 15/10/2025, 11:30:35, defines core functionalities for a Tizen Smart TV application. It includes `initAppTizen` which initializes the application by retrieving device information (model, manufacturer) and attaching event listeners. Crucially, it handles the application's lifecycle events: `visibilitychange` for pausing/resuming media playback (using `player.pause()` and `webapis.avplay.play()`) and navigating back, and `evExitApplication` for gracefully exiting the Tizen app. The file also provides `launchAppTizen` for launching other Tizen applications, including passing custom data, and `openSamsungStore` to redirect users to the Samsung SmartHub product detail page if an app launch fails or for specific promotions. The `TizenDevice` function primarily serves to kick off `initAppTizen`. This file is critical for platform-specific interactions and lifecycle management on Tizen devices.

The `index.jsx` file, timestamped 15/10/2025, 11:31:02, represents a complex React component responsible for rendering a dynamic content page, likely a home screen or a content category page, within the 3cat Smart TV application. It heavily leverages React hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`, `useRef`, etc.) and several custom hooks (`useFixedFocus`, `useVirtualizedRows`) to manage state, focus, and performance for potentially large lists of content.

Key functionalities include:
*   **Data Fetching**: `getHomeData` fetches personalized home screen data (differentiating for 'kid' profiles) and initiates real-time updates for live content. `getPageData` fetches content for other pages, including logic to identify and enrich "ranking" type pages.
*   **Live Content Management**: A significant portion of the code (`checkTimeFrame`, `mergeData`, `getNowPlayingSelectorData`, `refreshLives`) is dedicated to fetching, updating, and displaying live streaming content, refreshing it at a configurable interval (`live_refresh_interval`).
*   **Content Filtering**: The `filterChildren` function dynamically filters content based on platform capabilities, such as hiding live content or specific rows if live streaming or Shaka Player is not supported, and optimizing slider rendering.
*   **User Experience**: It integrates various UI components (rows, sliders, spinners, modals), handles user authentication status through `useAuthContext`, and manages navigation with `react-router-dom`. Error handling is implemented for API calls, redirecting on unauthorized access or token expiration.
*   **Global State & Events**: The component interacts with `window.AppGlobal` for global actions and listens to custom events like `menu:navigate` and `evChangeUser` to reset its state, indicating tight integration with the application's overall structure and menu system.

Recurring patterns across these changes highlight a multi-platform Smart TV application development approach with a strong focus on:
*   **Platform-specific Adaptations**: Explicit handling for Tizen OS in `tizen.js` and capability checks (`isLiveSupported`, `isShakaPlayerSupported`) in `index.jsx` suggest a robust architecture designed for different device capabilities.
*   **Real-time & Live Content**: Both files show a clear emphasis on supporting and managing live video streams, including their playback control and dynamic data updates.
*   **User-Centric Design**: Features like personalized content (kid profiles), authentication handling, intuitive navigation, and performance optimizations (virtualized rows, fixed focus) point to a focus on a rich user experience.
*   **Robustness**: Extensive error handling and event-driven state management are prevalent, crucial for stable application behavior on Smart TV platforms.
*   **Modularity**: The use of custom hooks, context providers, and separate API handler files indicates a modular codebase.

## 12:38:22
The changes primarily focus on the file `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js`, indicating continuous development and refinement of Tizen platform integration, particularly concerning application launching and store interaction.

**File-Specific Updates (`tizen.js`):**

*   **Initial State (15/10/2025, 11:43:58):** The file defines core Tizen application initialization (`initAppTizen`, `TizenDevice`) which includes fetching device information and attaching event listeners for `visibilitychange` (to pause/resume media playback and navigate history) and `evExitApplication`. It also provides `launchAppTizen` for launching other Tizen apps, with `openSamsungStore(appId)` as a basic fallback to open a product detail page in the store via a `tizenstore://` URI if the app launch fails.

*   **Enhanced Store Fallback Attempt (15/10/2025, 11:50:47):** A significant change introduced a more robust `handleTizenLaunchNotFound` fallback. This included `tryOpenTizenStoreUri` for URI-based store opening and `findInstalledStoreAppId` to programmatically search for and launch installed store applications if the direct URI failed.

*   **Reversion and Refocus (15/10/2025, 11:54:46):** The advanced fallback logic (`handleTizenLaunchNotFound`, `tryOpenTizenStoreUri`, `findInstalledStoreAppId`) was removed, reverting the `launchAppTizen` error handling to call the simpler `openSamsungStore(appId)`.

*   **New Store Opening Strategy (15/10/2025, 11:55:41):** A new `export const openTizenStore` function was introduced. Unlike the previous `openSamsungStore` which used a URI, this new function attempted to launch the Samsung Smart TV Store by iterating through a predefined list of potential store application IDs. The `launchAppTizen` error fallback was updated to call this new `openTizenStore`. The older `openSamsungStore` function remained in the code but was no longer called by `launchAppTizen`.

*   **Refined Store Application Control (15/10/2025, 12:05:37):** The `export const openTizenStore` was significantly refactored. It now explicitly targets the official store ID (`com.samsung.tv.store`) and uses `tizen.ApplicationControlData` to either open a specific app's detail page (if `appIdFromSellerOffice` is provided) or the store's "top apps" section.

*   **Hardcoded App ID and Parameter Default Change (15/10/2025, 12:06:13):** The `launchAppTizen` error handler temporarily hardcoded `ubrNshqKcU` as the app ID when calling `openTizenStore`. The `appIdFromSellerOffice` parameter in `openTizenStore` also had its default value changed to `null`.

*   **Confusing Reversion and Duplication (15/10/2025, 12:10:29):** The `launchAppTizen` error handler reverted to calling `openSamsungStore('ubrNshqKcU')`. This meant it was now calling the *older*, simpler `openSamsungStore` function again, while the more sophisticated `export const openTizenStore` still existed but was unused by this error path.

*   **Consolidation and Commenting (15/10/2025, 12:15:52):** The old `openSamsungStore` function was commented out, effectively removing it. The `launchAppTizen` error handler was updated to call `openTizenStore()` without arguments, leading to the store's "top apps" being opened.

*   **Restored App ID in Fallback (15/10/2025, 12:21:42):** The `launchAppTizen` error handler was updated to pass the failed `appId` to `openTizenStore(appId)` again, correctly attempting to open the specific app's detail page.

*   **Renaming and Search Fallback Introduction (15/10/2025, 12:29:43 & 12:30:13):** The `export const openTizenStore` function was renamed to `export const openSamsungStore`. It also gained an `appName` parameter. Crucially, if opening the store detail page fails, this new `openSamsungStore` now attempts to call an (initially undefined) `openTizenStoreSearch(appName)` function, indicating a further fallback to search functionality. `launchAppTizen`'s error handler was updated to reflect this rename and new parameter.

*   **Implemented Search Fallback (15/10/2025, 12:32:23):** The `openTizenStoreSearch(searchTerm)` function was added. This function opens the Samsung TV Store and performs a search using the provided `searchTerm`, completing the sophisticated fallback logic initiated in the previous step.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **15/10/2025, 11:50:47:** Introduction of a multi-step fallback mechanism (`handleTizenLaunchNotFound`) for app launch failures, including searching for installed store apps.
*   **15/10/2025, 11:54:46:** Complete reversion of the multi-step fallback, simplifying the store opening logic back to a direct URI call.
*   **15/10/2025, 11:55:41:** Shift to a new `export const openTizenStore` strategy, attempting to launch specific store app IDs.
*   **15/10/2025, 12:05:37:** Major refactor of `openTizenStore` to use `ApplicationControlData` for targeted store navigation (detail page or top apps) and explicitly targeting `com.samsung.tv.store`.
*   **15/10/2025, 12:15:52:** Consolidation: the older `openSamsungStore` was commented out, and `launchAppTizen` exclusively used the `export const openTizenStore`.
*   **15/10/2025, 12:29:43 & 12:32:23:** Renaming of `openTizenStore` to `openSamsungStore` and the introduction and implementation of a fallback to `openTizenStoreSearch` when attempting to open an app's detail page fails, marking the most comprehensive store interaction logic.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Centralized Tizen Platform Logic:** All changes are contained within a single `tizen.js` file, highlighting it as the central hub for Tizen-specific platform interactions.
*   **Evolving Store Interaction Strategy:** The most prominent pattern is the continuous iteration and refinement of how the application interacts with the Tizen/Samsung Store, especially as a fallback when launching other applications fails. This evolution moved from simple URI calls, through attempts at complex app ID searching, to a more structured approach using `ApplicationControlData` targeting the official store app, and finally incorporating a search fallback.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** A consistent focus on logging (`console.log`, `console.warn`, `console.error`) and error handling is evident throughout the `launchAppTizen` and store-related functions, ensuring that failures are reported and gracefully managed with fallbacks.
*   **Consistent Core App Initialization:** The `initAppTizen` and `TizenDevice` functions, responsible for initial setup, event listeners (like `visibilitychange` for media control and `evExitApplication`), and device information retrieval, remained largely stable, indicating a solid foundation for the Tizen application.
*   **Use of Tizen APIs:** The code heavily relies on `tizen.application`, `tizen.systeminfo`, and `tizen.ApplicationControl` APIs for interacting with the Tizen operating system and other applications.
*   **Commented-out Code:** The `/* eslint-disable */` comment appears consistently at the top of the file, indicating a relaxed linting rule for this specific file. Additionally, a previous version of `openSamsungStore` was explicitly commented out in later commits, demonstrating a clear decision to replace its functionality.

## 13:38:23
The code changes primarily affect platform-specific implementations for Tizen and WebOS smart TVs, along with updates to a core React page component.

**File: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js`**
This file, responsible for Tizen platform interactions, underwent frequent and significant changes between 15/10/2025, 12:39:33 and 13:09:03.
*   **Initial State (12:39:33)**: Included `initAppTizen` for device info and event listeners (`visibilitychange`, `evExitApplication`), `launchAppTizen` for launching other Tizen apps, `openSamsungStore` for displaying app details in the store, and `openTizenStoreSearch` for searching the store using `Sub_Menu: ['search']` and `Keyword`. On `launchAppTizen` failure, it attempted to search for 'rtveplay'.
*   **Search Functionality Iterations (12:43:47 - 12:49:50)**:
    *   `openTizenStoreSearch` was briefly modified to use `Sub_Menu: ['topApps']` (12:43:47), then reverted to `['search']` (12:46:45).
    *   The `openTizenStoreSearch` function was enhanced to include `SearchKey` and `SearchString` application control data parameters in addition to `Keyword`, aiming to make the search more robust (12:49:33).
*   **Store Redirection Change and Commenting (12:55:18 - 13:00:39)**:
    *   The `openTizenStoreSearch` function was entirely commented out (12:55:18), and `launchAppTizen`'s failure handler was changed to call `openSamsungStore(appId)`, attempting to show the detail page of the failed app.
    *   The `openSamsungStore` function was simplified by removing the `appName` parameter and fallback logic, and a detailed Spanish comment was added explaining the complexities of accessing the Samsung Store, including common error messages and requirements for `appIdFromSellerOffice` (13:00:39).
*   **Re-introduction and Final State (13:05:09 - 13:09:03)**:
    *   The `openTizenStoreSearch` function was re-enabled and heavily refactored (13:05:09). It now used `http://tizen.org/appcontrol/operation/search` and included a fallback mechanism: if the specific search failed, it would attempt to open the general 'topApps' section of the Samsung Store. Concurrently, `launchAppTizen`'s failure handling reverted to calling this re-introduced `openTizenStoreSearch('rtveplay')`.
    *   Almost immediately, `openTizenStoreSearch` was commented out again (13:09:03), and `launchAppTizen`'s failure handler reverted back to calling `openSamsungStore(appId)`. This suggests ongoing issues or design changes regarding the desired fallback behavior for app launch failures on Tizen.

**File: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\webos\webos.js`**
This file handles WebOS platform interactions.
*   **Initial State (15/10/2025, 13:17:12)**: Implemented `initAppWebos` for event listeners (`webOSLaunch`, `webOSRelaunch`, `visibilitychange`, `evExitApplication`), `launchAppWebOS` for launching other applications, and `openLGStore` for opening the LG Content Store. Upon failure to launch an app, `openLGStore(appId)` was called with the specific `appId`.
*   **Store Redirection Update (15/10/2025, 13:21:44)**: The `launchAppWebOS` failure fallback was modified to always redirect to the LG Content Store page for `cat.3cat.webos`, rather than the `appId` of the application that initially failed to launch.

**File: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\3Cat\appinfo.json`**
*   **Configuration Update (15/10/2025, 13:21:12)**: This file defines the metadata and configuration for the `3Cat` WebOS application. It was updated to set properties like `appDescription`, `icon`, `title`, `type`, `resolution`, `version` (`2.4.0`), `vendor`, `id` (`cat.3cat.webos2`), and `disableBackHistoryAPI`. This indicates an update to the application's core manifest.

**File: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx`**
This React component manages the main content page view.
*   **Initial State (15/10/2025, 13:18:24)**: The component handles data fetching for home and specific content pages, including live stream updates and filtering content based on platform capabilities (e.g., `isLiveSupported`). It manages UI state, user authentication, navigation, and virtualization of rows for performance. Event listeners for `menu:navigate` and `evChangeUser` are set up to reset page state.
*   **No Functional Change (15/10/2025, 13:21:25)**: The code content at this timestamp is identical to the previous entry, indicating a re-save without functional modifications.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Platform-Specific Logic**: A clear pattern of encapsulating platform-dependent code (Tizen, WebOS) into separate files, primarily for app launching and store interactions.
*   **Store Interaction Challenges**: There's a recurring theme of difficulty or uncertainty in how to best interact with the platform's app store. This is evident from the multiple changes, comments, and re-commenting of search and detail page functions in `tizen.js`, and the hardcoded fallback in `webos.js`.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: Frequent use of `try-catch` blocks and `onFailure`/`onError` callbacks with console logging for debugging platform-specific operations.
*   **Live Content Management**: The `index.jsx` component demonstrates a sophisticated mechanism for refreshing and integrating live content into the page display based on dynamic timeframes.
*   **Frequent Iteration**: The timestamps show rapid changes to the `tizen.js` file within a short period, suggesting active development, experimentation, and refinement of platform integration.

## 14:38:22
The provided log details changes primarily within the `webos.js` platform file, with a single entry for `index.jsx`, all occurring on **15/10/2025**.

**File: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\webos\webos.js`**

This file, responsible for webOS platform-specific functionalities, underwent a series of iterative refinements throughout the afternoon.

*   **15/10/2025, 13:41:30 (Initial State):** The file includes `initAppWebos` for attaching event listeners (`webOSLaunch`, `webOSRelaunch`, `visibilitychange`, `evExitApplication`), `launchAppWebOS` for launching other webOS applications, and `openLGStore` for redirecting to the LG Content Store using `keyword` and `query` parameters.
*   **15/10/2025, 13:47:37:** The `openLGStore` function was slightly modified to comment out `query: appId` and `contentType: 'apps'` from its internal `params.params` object, simplifying the LG Store deep link.
*   **15/10/2025, 13:50:00 - 14:00:34 (Keep Alive Adjustments):** The `launchAppWebOS` function was updated to include `keepAlive: true` for the launched application. Initially, it was placed within the `parameters` object (13:50:00), then later moved to be a direct property of the `webOS.service.request` call (14:00:34). Similarly, `keepAlive: true` was added to the `webOS.service.request` call within `openLGStore` at 13:50:13.
*   **15/10/2025, 14:06:09 - 14:06:26 (LG Store Parameter Refinement):** The way `openLGStore` constructs its parameters for the LG Content Store underwent changes. Initially, it attempted to use an undeclared `contentId` variable within `params.params` (14:06:09), which was quickly corrected to use `appId` in the same context (14:06:26).
*   **15/10/2025, 14:14:19 - 14:16:48 (Content ID Introduction and Documentation):**
    *   The `openLGStore` function's parameter was explicitly changed from `appId` to `contentId`.
    *   Comprehensive JSDoc-style comments were added above `openLGStore`, explaining what `contentId` is, how to obtain it from the LG Seller Office, and its usage restrictions.
    *   Calls to `openLGStore` within `launchAppWebOS` were updated to pass `appId` (e.g., `openLGStore(appId)`), creating a potential functional mismatch with the `contentId` parameter of `openLGStore`.
    *   The `console.log` message within `openLGStore` still referred to `appId` despite the function now taking `contentId`.
    *   The last entry (14:16:48) primarily re-formats the JSDoc comment for `openLGStore` into a standard block comment, with no functional code changes from the previous entry.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements in `webos.js`:**

*   **Debugging and Logging:** All changes consistently include `console.log` statements for tracing events, successful operations, warnings, and errors.
*   **Error Handling:** Extensive use of `try...catch` blocks is present for robust error management, particularly around calls to `webOS.service.request`.
*   **Platform Integration:** The code demonstrates deep integration with webOS specific APIs (e.g., `webOS.service.request`, `document.addEventListener` for `webOSLaunch`, `webOSRelaunch`).
*   **Focus on App Lifecycle:** The `initAppWebos` function clearly defines listeners for application launch, relaunch, visibility changes, and exit, indicating a structured approach to managing the app's lifecycle on webOS.
*   **LG Store Interaction:** A significant portion of the changes revolves around improving or adjusting the functionality to redirect users to the LG Content Store, particularly concerning how applications are identified (`appId` vs. `contentId`).

**File: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx`**

*   **15/10/2025, 14:17:11:** This single entry describes a comprehensive React functional component named `Page`. It appears to be a central view component for a smart TV application, possibly a home screen or a generic content page.
    *   **Component Structure:** It utilizes a wide array of React hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`, `useRef`, etc.), `react-router-dom` for navigation, and numerous custom components for UI (`GenericRow`, `SliderRow`, `Spinner`, modals, etc.).
    *   **Data Management:** The component fetches home and page data using various API handlers and manages the display of this data. It includes sophisticated logic for handling "Now Playing" content, live streams (`refreshLives`, `checkTimeFrame`, `mergeData`), and filtering content based on platform capabilities (`isLiveSupported`, `isShakaPlayerSupported`).
    *   **State and Context:** It manages states for loading, errors, page content, and user modals. It integrates multiple custom contexts (`AuthContext`, `SettingsContext`, `SitecatalystContext`, `HighlightContext`, `CapabilitiesContext`) to access global application state and functionalities.
    *   **Virtualization and Focus:** It employs custom hooks like `useFixedFocus` and `useVirtualizedRows` to optimize performance and user experience, especially on TV interfaces.
    *   **Event Handling:** It attaches event listeners for global application events like `menu:navigate` and `evChangeUser` to manage navigation state, clear virtualization, and reset application data.
    *   **User Modals:** It supports different types of user modals (e.g., for sign-in, registration, guest access) and tracks their visibility.

**Overall Patterns Across the Log:**

*   The modifications demonstrate active development on a smart TV application, specifically targeting webOS, focusing on core functionalities like app launching, event handling, content display, and user experience.
*   There's a clear emphasis on platform-specific integration and adaptation, evidenced by the `webos.js` changes and the capability checks in `index.jsx`.
*   The timestamps indicate a focused development session during the afternoon of October 15, 2025, with frequent commits or saves to the `webos.js` file as features were refined and documented.
