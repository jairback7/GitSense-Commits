# Activity Summary for 15/10/2025

## 11:38:10
The `tizen.js` file, timestamped 15/10/2025, 11:30:35, defines core functionalities for a Tizen Smart TV application. It includes `initAppTizen` which initializes the application by retrieving device information (model, manufacturer) and attaching event listeners. Crucially, it handles the application's lifecycle events: `visibilitychange` for pausing/resuming media playback (using `player.pause()` and `webapis.avplay.play()`) and navigating back, and `evExitApplication` for gracefully exiting the Tizen app. The file also provides `launchAppTizen` for launching other Tizen applications, including passing custom data, and `openSamsungStore` to redirect users to the Samsung SmartHub product detail page if an app launch fails or for specific promotions. The `TizenDevice` function primarily serves to kick off `initAppTizen`. This file is critical for platform-specific interactions and lifecycle management on Tizen devices.

The `index.jsx` file, timestamped 15/10/2025, 11:31:02, represents a complex React component responsible for rendering a dynamic content page, likely a home screen or a content category page, within the 3cat Smart TV application. It heavily leverages React hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`, `useRef`, etc.) and several custom hooks (`useFixedFocus`, `useVirtualizedRows`) to manage state, focus, and performance for potentially large lists of content.

Key functionalities include:
*   **Data Fetching**: `getHomeData` fetches personalized home screen data (differentiating for 'kid' profiles) and initiates real-time updates for live content. `getPageData` fetches content for other pages, including logic to identify and enrich "ranking" type pages.
*   **Live Content Management**: A significant portion of the code (`checkTimeFrame`, `mergeData`, `getNowPlayingSelectorData`, `refreshLives`) is dedicated to fetching, updating, and displaying live streaming content, refreshing it at a configurable interval (`live_refresh_interval`).
*   **Content Filtering**: The `filterChildren` function dynamically filters content based on platform capabilities, such as hiding live content or specific rows if live streaming or Shaka Player is not supported, and optimizing slider rendering.
*   **User Experience**: It integrates various UI components (rows, sliders, spinners, modals), handles user authentication status through `useAuthContext`, and manages navigation with `react-router-dom`. Error handling is implemented for API calls, redirecting on unauthorized access or token expiration.
*   **Global State & Events**: The component interacts with `window.AppGlobal` for global actions and listens to custom events like `menu:navigate` and `evChangeUser` to reset its state, indicating tight integration with the application's overall structure and menu system.

Recurring patterns across these changes highlight a multi-platform Smart TV application development approach with a strong focus on:
*   **Platform-specific Adaptations**: Explicit handling for Tizen OS in `tizen.js` and capability checks (`isLiveSupported`, `isShakaPlayerSupported`) in `index.jsx` suggest a robust architecture designed for different device capabilities.
*   **Real-time & Live Content**: Both files show a clear emphasis on supporting and managing live video streams, including their playback control and dynamic data updates.
*   **User-Centric Design**: Features like personalized content (kid profiles), authentication handling, intuitive navigation, and performance optimizations (virtualized rows, fixed focus) point to a focus on a rich user experience.
*   **Robustness**: Extensive error handling and event-driven state management are prevalent, crucial for stable application behavior on Smart TV platforms.
*   **Modularity**: The use of custom hooks, context providers, and separate API handler files indicates a modular codebase.

The changes primarily focus on the file `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js`, indicating continuous development and refinement of Tizen platform integration, particularly concerning application launching and store interaction.

**File-Specific Updates (`tizen.js`):**

*   **Initial State (15/10/2025, 11:43:58):** The file defines core Tizen application initialization (`initAppTizen`, `TizenDevice`) which includes fetching device information and attaching event listeners for `visibilitychange` (to pause/resume media playback and navigate history) and `evExitApplication`. It also provides `launchAppTizen` for launching other Tizen apps, with `openSamsungStore(appId)` as a basic fallback to open a product detail page in the store via a `tizenstore://` URI if the app launch fails.

*   **Enhanced Store Fallback Attempt (15/10/2025, 11:50:47):** A significant change introduced a more robust `handleTizenLaunchNotFound` fallback. This included `tryOpenTizenStoreUri` for URI-based store opening and `findInstalledStoreAppId` to programmatically search for and launch installed store applications if the direct URI failed.

*   **Reversion and Refocus (15/10/2025, 11:54:46):** The advanced fallback logic (`handleTizenLaunchNotFound`, `tryOpenTizenStoreUri`, `findInstalledStoreAppId`) was removed, reverting the `launchAppTizen` error handling to call the simpler `openSamsungStore(appId)`.

*   **New Store Opening Strategy (15/10/2025, 11:55:41):** A new `export const openTizenStore` function was introduced. Unlike the previous `openSamsungStore` which used a URI, this new function attempted to launch the Samsung Smart TV Store by iterating through a predefined list of potential store application IDs. The `launchAppTizen` error fallback was updated to call this new `openTizenStore`. The older `openSamsungStore` function remained in the code but was no longer called by `launchAppTizen`.

*   **Refined Store Application Control (15/10/2025, 12:05:37):** The `export const openTizenStore` was significantly refactored. It now explicitly targets the official store ID (`com.samsung.tv.store`) and uses `tizen.ApplicationControlData` to either open a specific app's detail page (if `appIdFromSellerOffice` is provided) or the store's "top apps" section.

*   **Hardcoded App ID and Parameter Default Change (15/10/2025, 12:06:13):** The `launchAppTizen` error handler temporarily hardcoded `ubrNshqKcU` as the app ID when calling `openTizenStore`. The `appIdFromSellerOffice` parameter in `openTizenStore` also had its default value changed to `null`.

*   **Confusing Reversion and Duplication (15/10/2025, 12:10:29):** The `launchAppTizen` error handler reverted to calling `openSamsungStore('ubrNshqKcU')`. This meant it was now calling the *older*, simpler `openSamsungStore` function again, while the more sophisticated `export const openTizenStore` still existed but was unused by this error path.

*   **Consolidation and Commenting (15/10/2025, 12:15:52):** The old `openSamsungStore` function was commented out, effectively removing it. The `launchAppTizen` error handler was updated to call `openTizenStore()` without arguments, leading to the store's "top apps" being opened.

*   **Restored App ID in Fallback (15/10/2025, 12:21:42):** The `launchAppTizen` error handler was updated to pass the failed `appId` to `openTizenStore(appId)` again, correctly attempting to open the specific app's detail page.

*   **Renaming and Search Fallback Introduction (15/10/2025, 12:29:43 & 12:30:13):** The `export const openTizenStore` function was renamed to `export const openSamsungStore`. It also gained an `appName` parameter. Crucially, if opening the store detail page fails, this new `openSamsungStore` now attempts to call an (initially undefined) `openTizenStoreSearch(appName)` function, indicating a further fallback to search functionality. `launchAppTizen`'s error handler was updated to reflect this rename and new parameter.

*   **Implemented Search Fallback (15/10/2025, 12:32:23):** The `openTizenStoreSearch(searchTerm)` function was added. This function opens the Samsung TV Store and performs a search using the provided `searchTerm`, completing the sophisticated fallback logic initiated in the previous step.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **15/10/2025, 11:50:47:** Introduction of a multi-step fallback mechanism (`handleTizenLaunchNotFound`) for app launch failures, including searching for installed store apps.
*   **15/10/2025, 11:54:46:** Complete reversion of the multi-step fallback, simplifying the store opening logic back to a direct URI call.
*   **15/10/2025, 11:55:41:** Shift to a new `export const openTizenStore` strategy, attempting to launch specific store app IDs.
*   **15/10/2025, 12:05:37:** Major refactor of `openTizenStore` to use `ApplicationControlData` for targeted store navigation (detail page or top apps) and explicitly targeting `com.samsung.tv.store`.
*   **15/10/2025, 12:15:52:** Consolidation: the older `openSamsungStore` was commented out, and `launchAppTizen` exclusively used the `export const openTizenStore`.
*   **15/10/2025, 12:29:43 & 12:32:23:** Renaming of `openTizenStore` to `openSamsungStore` and the introduction and implementation of a fallback to `openTizenStoreSearch` when attempting to open an app's detail page fails, marking the most comprehensive store interaction logic.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Centralized Tizen Platform Logic:** All changes are contained within a single `tizen.js` file, highlighting it as the central hub for Tizen-specific platform interactions.
*   **Evolving Store Interaction Strategy:** The most prominent pattern is the continuous iteration and refinement of how the application interacts with the Tizen/Samsung Store, especially as a fallback when launching other applications fails. This evolution moved from simple URI calls, through attempts at complex app ID searching, to a more structured approach using `ApplicationControlData` targeting the official store app, and finally incorporating a search fallback.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** A consistent focus on logging (`console.log`, `console.warn`, `console.error`) and error handling is evident throughout the `launchAppTizen` and store-related functions, ensuring that failures are reported and gracefully managed with fallbacks.
*   **Consistent Core App Initialization:** The `initAppTizen` and `TizenDevice` functions, responsible for initial setup, event listeners (like `visibilitychange` for media control and `evExitApplication`), and device information retrieval, remained largely stable, indicating a solid foundation for the Tizen application.
*   **Use of Tizen APIs:** The code heavily relies on `tizen.application`, `tizen.systeminfo`, and `tizen.ApplicationControl` APIs for interacting with the Tizen operating system and other applications.
*   **Commented-out Code:** The `/* eslint-disable */` comment appears consistently at the top of the file, indicating a relaxed linting rule for this specific file. Additionally, a previous version of `openSamsungStore` was explicitly commented out in later commits, demonstrating a clear decision to replace its functionality.
