# Activity Summary for 21/10/2025

## 16:37:37
The provided log details recent code changes primarily impacting Tizen platform integration and a core React page component responsible for content display and dynamic updates.

**File: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js`**
*   **Timestamp:** 21/10/2025, 16:29:08
*   This file introduces comprehensive Tizen platform functionality. It includes `initAppTizen` for initializing the application, retrieving device information (model, manufacturer), and attaching event listeners for `visibilitychange` (to pause/resume playback and navigate history) and `evExitApplication` (to exit the app).
*   The `launchAppTizen` function facilitates launching other Tizen applications using `ApplicationControl`, passing parameters dynamically, and includes error handling that falls back to opening the Samsung Store if the launch fails.
*   A key feature is `openSamsungStore`, which is designed to navigate to a specific app's detail page within the Samsung TV Store. Extensive comments detail the complexities and restrictions of accessing the Samsung Store from development environments, including common errors like "Servidor en mantenimiento" (Error 1544007) related to app signing and publication status, and the use of `widget_id` and `caller_id`. A function for opening the store search (`openTizenStoreSearch`) is present but commented out, indicating potential past or future functionality.

**File: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx`**
*   **Timestamp:** 21/10/2025, 16:29:15
*   This is a central React component (`Page`) managing the display of home and content pages. It incorporates a wide array of React hooks, custom hooks (`useFixedFocus`, `useVirtualizedRows`), and context APIs (`useAuthContext`, `useSettings`, `useCapabilitiesContext`) for state management, navigation, and user authentication.
*   The component handles dynamic data fetching for both general pages (`getPageData`) and the home screen (`getHomeData`), with specific logic for child profiles (`activeUser?.type === 'kid'`) and "ranking" pages ("mes-top").
*   A significant part of the changes revolves around real-time content updates, particularly for live streams. Functions like `refreshLives`, `getNowPlayingSelectorData`, `checkTimeFrame`, and `mergeData` work together to fetch "now playing" data, filter it by timeframes, and dynamically update the displayed content, including slider items, at a defined `live_refresh_interval`.
*   The `filterChildren` function is critical for dynamically adjusting the content based on platform capabilities and context. It filters out live content if `isLiveSupported` is false, removes rows without children, hides "CANALS TEMÃ€TICS" if `isShakaPlayerSupported` is false, and notably, includes HBBTV-specific logic to filter out rows containing external content.
*   Multiple `useEffect` hooks manage component lifecycle, including updating capability refs, setting up and cleaning event listeners for `menu:navigate` (resetting virtualization) and `evChangeUser` (resetting application state upon user change). It also manages initial data loading and resets.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Platform-specific adaptations:** The log clearly shows a pattern of adapting application behavior based on the detected platform (Tizen in `tizen.js`, HBBTV and general capabilities like live support and Shaka player in `index.jsx`).
*   **Dynamic Content Management:** Both files contribute to dynamically updating and filtering content. `tizen.js` handles launching other apps with dynamic data, while `index.jsx` excels at filtering and refreshing displayed content based on user state, time, and device capabilities.
*   **Extensive Logging and Error Handling:** `console.log`, `console.warn`, and `console.error` are heavily used across both files for debugging and tracing application flow, especially for platform interactions and API calls. `try...catch` blocks are consistently employed for robust error management.
*   **Event-driven Architecture:** The use of `document.addEventListener` for `visibilitychange`, `evExitApplication`, `menu:navigate`, and `evChangeUser` indicates an event-driven approach to react to significant application and user events.
*   **Context and Hooks in React:** In `index.jsx`, there's a strong reliance on React's Context API and custom hooks for managing global state, capabilities, and UI interactions, demonstrating modern React development practices.

The provided log details changes across three distinct files, primarily focusing on webOS platform integration and a React application's page rendering logic, all occurring on October 21, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\webos\webos.js`**
    *   **Timestamp of initial state: 21/10/2025, 16:39:01.** This file defines core webOS application behaviors, including event listeners for `webOSLaunch`, `webOSRelaunch`, `visibilitychange`, and `evExitApplication`. It also provides functions `launchAppWebOS` to launch other applications and `openLGStore` to redirect to the LG Content Store, initially by `contentId`.
    *   **Subsequent changes (21/10/2025, 16:51:14 to 17:32:41)** reveal a dynamic and iterative development process for handling LG Content Store interactions.
        *   Initially, a minor adjustment was made to the console log in `openLGStore` (16:51:14).
        *   The logic for `openLGStore` underwent several rapid changes, switching between using `appId` as a `keyword`, `contentId`, or a combination, and commenting out different `params` configurations (16:59:41, 16:59:52, 17:00:28).
        *   A new function, `openLGStoreAppDetail`, was introduced (17:08:18) to open a specific app's detail page in the store using `action: "OPEN_DETAIL"`, replacing the general `openLGStore` call on app launch failure.
        *   This `openLGStoreAppDetail` function was then temporarily modified to use a hardcoded `keyword: 'Caixaforum+'` (17:25:01), suggesting a test.
        *   Finally, the code reverted to using `openLGStore` for app launch failures, with the `openLGStore` function itself undergoing further revisions where various `params` options (like `keyword`, `contentId`, `category`) were commented in and out, indicating an ongoing struggle or refinement in how to reliably open the LG Content Store (17:30:18, 17:30:43, 17:32:41).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 21/10/2025, 16:39:46.** This file represents a significant React component (`Page`) for rendering dynamic content. It imports numerous components, hooks, API handlers, and contexts, showcasing a comprehensive approach to managing application state and user experience.
    *   Key functionalities include: fetching and rendering home and generic page data; handling user authentication and navigation; dynamically updating live content (using `checkTimeFrame`, `mergeData`, `getNowPlayingSelectorData`, `refreshLives`); filtering content rows based on platform capabilities (e.g., `isLiveSupported`, `isShakaPlayerSupported`) and HBBTV-specific restrictions; and setting up event listeners for menu navigation and user changes to reset the page state. This log entry provides a detailed snapshot of a complex React component.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\3Cat\appinfo.json`**
    *   **Timestamp: 21/10/2025, 16:40:59.** This is the manifest file for the 3Cat webOS application. It defines metadata such as `appDescription`, `icon`, `main` HTML file, `title`, `version` (2.4.0), `vendor`, `id` (`cat.3cat.webos`), and UI settings like `resolution` and `disableBackHistoryAPI`. No specific changes were logged for this file, only its existence and content at this timestamp.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **WebOS-Specific Development**: There is a strong emphasis on developing for the webOS platform, evidenced by event listeners for webOS lifecycle events and the frequent use of `luna://com.webos.applicationManager` for inter-app communication and LG Content Store integration.
*   **Iterative Refinement of External App Launching**: The `webos.js` file shows a clear pattern of rapid, sequential modifications related to the `openLGStore` function, indicating ongoing challenges or experiments in getting the LG Content Store redirection or app detail launching to work as desired. This suggests debugging or testing different approaches to interact with the webOS ecosystem's store.
*   **Comprehensive React Architecture**: The `index.jsx` file demonstrates a well-structured React application, leveraging context API for state management, hooks for component logic, and dedicated functions for data handling, filtering, and API interactions.
*   **Live Content Management**: A notable recurring theme in `index.jsx` is the detailed logic for managing and refreshing live content, including complex data merging and filtering based on timeframes and platform capabilities.
*   **Timestamp Concentration**: All changes occurred on the same date, October 21, 2025, within a short timeframe (less than an hour). This suggests a focused development session, possibly addressing a specific feature or bug related to webOS integration and app store interactions.

## 19:37:29
The code changes primarily focus on enhancing the display and navigation of various content items within a Smart TV application, with a particular emphasis on live and external content, and an underlying custom focus management system. All modifications occurred on **21/10/2025**, within a concentrated period between **17:52:23** and **18:13:33**.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\landscapeItem\index.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 21/10/2025, 17:52:23
    *   This component received updates to dynamically fetch `channelLogo` from `item.stream` if not initially present, especially for 'Home' collection 'now-playing-selector' items.
    *   Enhanced focus management was implemented with additional `data-nav-strategy`, `data-block-focus-up/right/left`, `data-on-lost-left-action`, and `data-on-focused-action` attributes, and `isLastRow` now triggers `data-block-focus-down`.
    *   A `platform-footer` was introduced to display `platform-logo` and an external link icon (`icLinkExterior.svg`) for external content items.
    *   Conditional rendering for `series-title` (only if not an episode) and `title` (only if not a stream collection) was added.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 21/10/2025, 17:53:16
    *   This initial commit of the `LiveItemHome` component introduced logic for displaying live channel information, including generating image data (`generateImageDataFromLiveChannelInHome_v2`), calculating a progress `percentage` for a `TimeLine` component, and determining `mediaType`. It also includes conditional rendering for external content (platform logo and icon), audio icons, and a dynamic title combining `h1`/`h2` and presenter information for audio streams.
    *   **Timestamp:** 21/10/2025, 17:55:01
    *   A temporary change was introduced where `isExternal` was hardcoded to `true`, forcing all `LiveItemHome` items to be treated as external content.
    *   **Timestamp:** 21/10/2025, 17:57:06
    *   The `isExternal` hardcoding was reverted to its original conditional logic (`item.is_external || item.external_content_data?.platform_image`). Additionally, the `platformLogo` check was removed from the `platform-footer` rendering condition, meaning the footer would display as long as `isExternal` was true, regardless of `platformLogo`'s presence.
    *   **Timestamp:** 21/10/2025, 18:02:35
    *   The change at 17:57:06 was reverted, re-introducing the `platformLogo` check back into the `platform-footer` rendering condition (`isExternal && platformLogo`). This ensures the platform footer only appears if both `isExternal` is true and a `platformLogo` exists.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\styles.scss`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 21/10/2025, 17:54:37
    *   Initial styling for `liveItemHome` was added, defining layout, dimensions, and visual effects like a bottom-top gradient. Crucially, it introduced styles for `.external-content`, increasing its height and adjusting the `infoContainer`'s position. It also detailed styling for `.platform-footer`, `platform-logo`, `platform-icon`, and `title` with text truncation.
    *   **Timestamp:** 21/10/2025, 18:01:42
    *   This timestamp indicates a re-save or minor, non-functional edit, as the content of the file is identical to the previous version.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 21/10/2025, 17:59:14
    *   The `GenericRow` component was updated to include `LiveItemHome` and `LastDayItem` as recognized row types. These types were integrated into the `getRowElement` and `getShowAllElementFocusShape` functions.
    *   Similar to `LiveItemHome`, the `isExternalRow` calculation was temporarily hardcoded to `true`, forcing the `externalRow` class on generic rows. Additional conditional data attributes were added to row elements for refined navigation control.
    *   **Timestamp:** 21/10/2025, 18:02:12
    *   The hardcoding of `isExternalRow` was reverted, restoring its original dynamic determination based on children's external content data.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\styles.scss`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 21/10/2025, 17:59:55
    *   This file provides styling for various `generic_row` types (`HERO`, `LANDSCAPE`, `LIVE_TV`, `PORTRAIT`, `SQUARE`, etc.), including specific height adjustments for `.externalRow` within `LANDSCAPE` and `LIVE_TV` types. It also defines the appearance and positioning for the "show all" element icon across different row types.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 21/10/2025, 18:04:33
    *   Significant updates to the `Page` component:
        *   New contexts (`useHighlightContext`, `useCapabilitiesContext`) and utilities (`Platform`, `ExternalContentModal`, user modal handlers) were integrated.
        *   A new `filterChildren` function was added to dynamically filter row content based on `isLiveSupported` and `isShakaPlayerSupported` capabilities. Notably, it filters out rows with external content on the `hbbtv` platform.
        *   `useEffect` hooks were introduced to manage supported capabilities, and event listeners (`menu:navigate`, `evChangeUser`) were added to reset application state, virtualization, and focus on specific navigation or user changes.
        *   The live content refresh mechanism (`refreshLives`, `nowPlayingSelectorTimmerRef`) was refined, fetching and merging now-playing data from multiple channels.
    *   **Timestamp:** 21/10/2025, 18:13:33
    *   This timestamp indicates a re-save or minor, non-functional edit, as the content of the file is identical to the previous version.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Focus Management System:** A prominent pattern is the extensive use of `registerFocusAction` and `unregisterFocusAction` across multiple components (`LandscapeItem`, `LiveItemHome`, `GenericRow`). This indicates a custom, robust focus management system crucial for Smart TV user interfaces controlled by remote or keyboard.
*   **External Content Integration:** The repeated use of `isExternal`, `external-content` class, `platform-footer`, `platform-logo`, and `icLinkExterior.svg` highlights a consistent approach to identifying, styling, and linking to external content sources.
*   **Dynamic Component Rendering:** `GenericRow` exemplifies a pattern of dynamically selecting and rendering specific item components (`LandscapeItem`, `LiveItemHome`, etc.) based on `rowType`, centralizing row layout logic.
*   **Live Content Handling:** `LiveItemHome` and `Page` both show specialized logic for processing and displaying live stream data, including progress bars and periodic refreshes, indicating a focus on real-time content.
*   **Conditional Rendering and Styling:** Components frequently use conditional logic to apply CSS classes (e.g., `${isExternal ? 'external-content' : ''}`) and HTML attributes (e.g., `{...(props.dataBlockFocusUp && { 'data-block-focus-up': props.dataBlockFocusUp })}`) for dynamic presentation and navigation behavior.
*   **Platform-Specific Adaptations:** The `Page` component's `filterChildren` function demonstrates logic to adapt content display based on platform capabilities (e.g., `isLiveSupported`, `isShakaPlayerSupported`) and platform-specific restrictions (e.g., filtering external content for `hbbtv`).
*   **Rapid Iteration:** The close timestamps of changes, especially the temporary hardcoding and subsequent reversions in `liveItemHome\index.jsx` and `genericRow\index.jsx`, suggest an active development or debugging phase, possibly related to quickly testing and refining external content integration.
