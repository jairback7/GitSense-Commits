The provided log details recent code changes primarily impacting Tizen platform integration and a core React page component responsible for content display and dynamic updates.

**File: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js`**

*   This file introduces comprehensive Tizen platform functionality. It includes `initAppTizen` for initializing the application, retrieving device information (model, manufacturer), and attaching event listeners for `visibilitychange` (to pause/resume playback and navigate history) and `evExitApplication` (to exit the app).
*   The `launchAppTizen` function facilitates launching other Tizen applications using `ApplicationControl`, passing parameters dynamically, and includes error handling that falls back to opening the Samsung Store if the launch fails.
*   A key feature is `openSamsungStore`, which is designed to navigate to a specific app's detail page within the Samsung TV Store. Extensive comments detail the complexities and restrictions of accessing the Samsung Store from development environments, including common errors like "Servidor en mantenimiento" (Error 1544007) related to app signing and publication status, and the use of `widget_id` and `caller_id`. A function for opening the store search (`openTizenStoreSearch`) is present but commented out, indicating potential past or future functionality.

**File: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx`**
*   **Timestamp:** 21/10/2025, 16:29:15
*   This is a central React component (`Page`) managing the display of home and content pages. It incorporates a wide array of React hooks, custom hooks (`useFixedFocus`, `useVirtualizedRows`), and context APIs (`useAuthContext`, `useSettings`, `useCapabilitiesContext`) for state management, navigation, and user authentication.
*   The component handles dynamic data fetching for both general pages (`getPageData`) and the home screen (`getHomeData`), with specific logic for child profiles (`activeUser?.type === 'kid'`) and "ranking" pages ("mes-top").
*   A significant part of the changes revolves around real-time content updates, particularly for live streams. Functions like `refreshLives`, `getNowPlayingSelectorData`, `checkTimeFrame`, and `mergeData` work together to fetch "now playing" data, filter it by timeframes, and dynamically update the displayed content, including slider items, at a defined `live_refresh_interval`.
*   The `filterChildren` function is critical for dynamically adjusting the content based on platform capabilities and context. It filters out live content if `isLiveSupported` is false, removes rows without children, hides "CANALS TEMÃ€TICS" if `isShakaPlayerSupported` is false, and notably, includes HBBTV-specific logic to filter out rows containing external content.
*   Multiple `useEffect` hooks manage component lifecycle, including updating capability refs, setting up and cleaning event listeners for `menu:navigate` (resetting virtualization) and `evChangeUser` (resetting application state upon user change). It also manages initial data loading and resets.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Platform-specific adaptations:** The log clearly shows a pattern of adapting application behavior based on the detected platform (Tizen in `tizen.js`, HBBTV and general capabilities like live support and Shaka player in `index.jsx`).
*   **Dynamic Content Management:** Both files contribute to dynamically updating and filtering content. `tizen.js` handles launching other apps with dynamic data, while `index.jsx` excels at filtering and refreshing displayed content based on user state, time, and device capabilities.
*   **Extensive Logging and Error Handling:** `console.log`, `console.warn`, and `console.error` are heavily used across both files for debugging and tracing application flow, especially for platform interactions and API calls. `try...catch` blocks are consistently employed for robust error management.
*   **Event-driven Architecture:** The use of `document.addEventListener` for `visibilitychange`, `evExitApplication`, `menu:navigate`, and `evChangeUser` indicates an event-driven approach to react to significant application and user events.
*   **Context and Hooks in React:** In `index.jsx`, there's a strong reliance on React's Context API and custom hooks for managing global state, capabilities, and UI interactions, demonstrating modern React development practices.
