# Activity Summary for 22/10/2025

## 13:13:08
The changes primarily focus on enhancing platform-specific functionality for WebOS and refining a core React component responsible for displaying dynamic page content.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\webos\webos.js` (Timestamp: 22/10/2025, 12:36:22)**
    This file introduces comprehensive WebOS platform integration. It initializes the app by attaching event listeners for key lifecycle events: `webOSLaunch` (for foreground activity), `webOSRelaunch` (for background activity), `visibilitychange` (to detect when the app becomes hidden or visible, triggering `window.AppGlobal.Actions.onVisibilityChange`), and `evExitApplication` (to close the app).
    New functionality includes `launchAppWebOS`, an exported function designed to launch other WebOS applications using the `luna://com.webos.applicationManager` service, with a `keepAlive: true` option. In case of launch failure, it attempts to redirect to the LG Content Store.
    The `openLGStore` function provides a mechanism to navigate the user to the LG Content Store for a specific `contentId`, with detailed instructions on how to obtain this ID. The `WebosDevice` function serves as the default export, initiating these WebOS-specific behaviors.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (Timestamp: 22/10/2025, 12:37:03)**
    This is a significant update to a React component responsible for rendering dynamic page content, likely a home or content detail page. It incorporates numerous React hooks, router functionalities, and various UI components.
    Key features include:
    *   **State and Context Management:** Extensive use of `useState`, `useRef`, and several React Contexts (`authContext`, `settingsContext`, `sitecatalystContext`, `highlightContext`, `capabilitiesContext`) for managing page state, user authentication, settings, analytics, and device capabilities.
    *   **Data Fetching and Live Content Refresh:** It fetches initial page data (`getHomeData` or `getPageData`) and includes sophisticated logic (`checkTimeFrame`, `mergeData`, `refreshLives`) to continuously fetch and update "now playing" live stream data using `ApiGetNowPlayingSelector` and `ApiGetNowPlaying`. This live data refresh is managed with an `setInterval` based on `settingsData.live_refresh_interval`.
    *   **Content Filtering:** The `filterChildren` function dynamically adjusts the displayed content based on various conditions, including:
        *   Removing live content rows if `isLiveSupported` is false.
        *   Excluding rows without children or with empty children.
        *   Filtering out "CANALS TEMÃ€TICS" if `isShakaPlayerSupported` is false.
        *   Removing all but the first slider row.
        *   Crucially, for the `hbbtv` platform, it filters out rows that contain external content.
    *   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is implemented for API calls, specifically managing "Unauthorized" or "Token expired" messages by triggering logout or redirection to an authentication screen.
    *   **UI/UX Enhancements:** Integrates custom hooks `useFixedFocus` and `useVirtualizedRows` for performance and navigation. Event listeners (`menu:navigate`, `evChangeUser`) are set up to reset the component's state, virtualization, and focus when a user navigates or changes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Platform-Specific Adaptations:** Both files demonstrate a strong emphasis on adapting application behavior based on the target platform or device capabilities. `webos.js` is entirely dedicated to WebOS interactions, while `index.jsx` includes explicit checks for `window.AppGlobal.platform === 'hbbtv'` and capabilities like `isLiveSupported` and `isShakaPlayerSupported` to conditionally render or filter content.
*   **API Interaction and Asynchronous Data Handling:** There's extensive use of asynchronous API calls for data retrieval, often involving Promises and `setInterval` for continuous updates, especially for live content.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** The application leverages both native platform events (e.g., `webOSLaunch`, `visibilitychange`) and custom events (`menu:navigate`, `evChangeUser`) to manage application flow and state changes.
*   **Robust Error Management:** Consistent error handling is present across API calls and platform interactions, often leading to user feedback, reauthentication, or redirection.
*   **Timestamps Proximity:** The timestamps (22/10/2025, 12:36:22 and 22/10/2025, 12:37:03) are very close, suggesting these changes were committed around the same time, likely as part of a single feature development or release targeting platform compatibility and content presentation.
*   **Extensive Logging:** Frequent `console.log` statements are used throughout the code for debugging and tracing execution, indicating a thorough approach to monitoring application behavior, especially in complex areas like platform integration and data updates.
