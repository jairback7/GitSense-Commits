# Activity Summary for 16/10/2025

The file `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platformConfig.js` was updated twice on 16/10/2025, with timestamps at 14:02:21 and 14:04:28.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`platformConfig.js`**: This file is responsible for global application configuration, platform detection, and resolution handling for a SmartTV application. It initializes `window.AppGlobal` with various properties related to actions, platform, app version, TV OS version, detail views, player controls (audios, subtitles), search, and pages. It also defines `window.PlatformUtils` for user agent retrieval, platform identification, resolution configuration, and OS version detection.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   The key change occurred between 14:02:21 and 14:04:28 on 16/10/2025, indicating a quick, focused modification.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   The file consistently uses `window.AppGlobal` and `window.PlatformUtils` objects to manage global state and utility functions.
*   It implements platform detection logic based on the user agent string, supporting platforms like "browser", "tizen", "webos", "hisense", "lg", and "hbbtv".
*   It includes logic for dynamically injecting platform-specific libraries (e.g., `webOSTV.js` for webOS).
*   Resolution configuration is managed, supporting '720p' and '1080p' based on window dimensions, with a mechanism to add corresponding CSS classes to the `<body>` element.
*   OS version retrieval is implemented for various platforms using their respective APIs (e.g., `webOS.service.request` for webOS, `tizen.systeminfo.getCapabilities` for Tizen, user agent parsing for HbbTV).
*   The most notable change between the two timestamps is within the `window.PlatformUtils.getPlatform` function. The earlier version (14:02:21) dynamically determined the platform based on the user agent, returning `platform`. The later version (14:04:28) hardcodes the return value to `'hbbtv'`, effectively overriding the dynamic detection and forcing the application to identify as an HbbTV platform, regardless of the actual environment. The original `return platform;` line was commented out in favor of `return 'hbbtv';`.
