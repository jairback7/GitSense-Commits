# Activity Summary for 27/10/2025

## 8:57:31
The provided code logs detail platform-specific implementations for Tizen and webOS smart TV applications, primarily focusing on application lifecycle management, inter-app communication, and app store redirection. The timestamps indicate these changes occurred on 27/10/2025, around 8:37 AM and 8:39 AM, suggesting concurrent development or a single session of updates across platform integrations.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (Timestamp: 27/10/2025, 8:37:26)**
    *   **Initialization (`initAppTizen`)**: Retrieves Tizen device model and manufacturer information.
    *   **Event Handling**: Attaches listeners for `visibilitychange` and `evExitApplication`.
        *   When the app is hidden, it attempts to pause a `player`, navigate back in history, and stop `webapis.avplay`.
        *   When the app is resumed, it calls `window.AppGlobal.Actions.onVisibilityChange()` and resumes `webapis.avplay`.
        *   `evExitApplication` triggers a graceful exit of the Tizen application.
    *   **App Launching (`launchAppTizen`)**: Provides a mechanism to launch other Tizen applications using `tizen.ApplicationControl` with custom parameters. If the launch fails, it attempts to open the Samsung Store.
    *   **Store Redirection (`openSamsungStore`)**: Facilitates opening the Samsung Content Store to display details for a specific application ID.
    *   The `TizenDevice` function acts as the main entry point, calling `initAppTizen`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\webos\webos.js` (Timestamp: 27/10/2025, 8:39:30)**
    *   **Initialization (`initAppWebos`)**:
    *   **Event Handling**: Attaches listeners for `webOSLaunch`, `webOSRelaunch`, `visibilitychange`, and `evExitApplication`.
        *   `webOSLaunch` and `webOSRelaunch` log details about the app's launch/relaunch.
        *   `visibilitychange` logs the app's visibility state and calls `window.AppGlobal.Actions.onVisibilityChange()` when visible.
        *   `evExitApplication` triggers `window.close()` to exit the webOS application.
    *   **App Launching (`launchAppWebOS`)**: Utilizes `luna://com.webos.applicationManager` service requests to launch other webOS applications. It includes a fallback to open the LG Store if the launch fails.
    *   **Store Redirection (`openLGStore`)**: Attempts to launch the LG Content Store. Commented-out parameters suggest various ways to open the store (e.g., by keyword, contentId, or category), indicating potential past or future implementations for deep linking.
    *   The `WebosDevice` function acts as the main entry point, calling `initAppWebos`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Platform-Specific Adapters**: Both files implement similar functionalities tailored to their respective smart TV platforms (Tizen and webOS). This includes application lifecycle management, event listeners, and launching other applications or app stores.
*   **Application Lifecycle Management**: Both platforms handle application visibility (`visibilitychange`) and exit events (`evExitApplication`, `webOSLaunch`, `webOSRelaunch`), indicating a focus on maintaining app state and behavior during these transitions.
*   **Inter-App Communication/Launching**: Both provide `launchApp` functions (`launchAppTizen`, `launchAppWebOS`) to initiate other applications on the device, often passing parameters.
*   **App Store Fallback**: A common pattern is to redirect to the platform's app store (Samsung Store for Tizen, LG Store for webOS) if an attempt to launch another application fails.
*   **Extensive Logging**: Both files use `console.log` and `console.warn`/`console.error` extensively for debugging and tracking the flow of execution, including success and failure messages for various operations.
*   **Shared Global Action**: Both platforms interact with a `window.AppGlobal.Actions.onVisibilityChange()` function when the application becomes visible, suggesting a unified action handler for visibility changes across different platforms.
*   **Timestamp Proximity**: The close timestamps suggest these changes were made around the same time, possibly as part of a feature rollout or bug fix affecting both platforms.

## 19:58:06
The code changes primarily revolve around the `PopupInfoGroup` React component and its associated styling, with a brief update to `ExternalContentModal` to utilize this component. The overall goal appears to be enhancing the display of media information, including tags, duration, season/episode counts, publication dates, and age ratings, within pop-up interfaces.

**File-Specific Updates:**

**1. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\popupInfoGroup\index.jsx`**

*   **Initial state and early modifications (27/10/2025, 19:08:35 - 19:15:45):** The component `PopupInfoGroup` initially included basic rendering of `MediaTag`, `MediaTitle`, `Duration`, `AgeRateImg`, and `MediaFeatures`. A temporary hardcoding of `item.rating_tags` was observed, first with repetitive "Sexe" labels, then expanded to a list including "Violència", " Por i angoixa", "Consum de droga", "Discriminació", and "Llenguatge grolle", and briefly an extra "Discriminació", before reverting to the extended list without the duplicate. This suggests testing or refinement of rating tag display.
*   **Adding structural and data-driven elements (27/10/2025, 19:31:51 - 19:38:57):**
    *   Several new functional components were introduced: `EpisodeCount` (for chapter counts), `SeasonsCount` (for season counts, using `useText` for localization), and `Publication` (to format and display `licensed_on` dates).
    *   A `renderSeasonOrEpisodeCount` function was added to conditionally render season or episode information.
    *   `useMemo` hooks (`showPublication`, `showSeasonOrEpisodeCount`, `showTags`, `showDuration`) were incorporated to optimize the rendering of these new data points.
    *   The `MAX_EPISODES` constant was introduced, deriving its value from `settingsData?.show_max_episodes` or defaulting to 200, replacing an earlier `LIVE_REFRESH_INTERVAL` reference. This involved importing `useSettings` from `../../../contexts/settingsContext` (at 19:37:53) to access `settingsData`.
    *   The JSX structure for `popupMetaRow` was significantly altered to dynamically render these new information types (`showTags`, `showDuration`, `showSeasonOrEpisodeCount`, `showExpiration_v2`, `showPublication`) separated by a `DrawADoth_v2` component.
    *   `useMemo` was explicitly imported from 'react' (at 19:38:57).
*   **Refinement and temporary issues with `DrawADoth_v2` (27/10/2025, 19:42:31 - 19:45:00):**
    *   The dependencies and conditions for `showTags` and `showDuration` `useMemo` hooks were simplified.
    *   A custom `DrawADoth_v2` component was defined directly within `PopupInfoGroup` to intelligently render a separator dot (`·`) only when there's a subsequent visible item in a list.
    *   There were temporary inconsistencies in the `dothSeparatedItems` array content and the rendering logic in `popupMetaRow`, leading to `showExpiration_v2` being referenced despite not being consistently defined or included. The order of elements being rendered with dots was also adjusted.
*   **Rollback of `popupMetaRow` enhancements (27/10/2025, 19:48:34):** The complex `dothSeparatedItems` rendering logic within `popupMetaRow`, including `DrawADoth_v2` and the new `showTags`, `showSeasonOrEpisodeCount`, `showDuration`, `showPublication` components, was *removed* from the JSX. The `popupMetaRow` reverted to its simpler, mostly commented-out state, implying a temporary rollback or reconsideration of this specific display feature.
*   **Description text cleaning attempt (27/10/2025, 19:51:04 - 19:51:53):** A change was introduced to process the `description` with a `cleanHtmlText` function, but this was quickly reverted (and a syntax error fixed in between) back to directly using `item?.abstract || ""`, suggesting `cleanHtmlText` was either not ready, removed, or deemed unnecessary for this component.
*   The hardcoded `item.rating_tags` was removed in the final logged change (19:51:53), indicating it was likely for development/testing purposes.

**2. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\popupInfoGroup\styles.scss`**

*   **General layout and typography adjustments (27/10/2025, 19:09:47 - 19:15:56):**
    *   `popupMetaRow, .popupTagsRow` alignment changed from `center` to `flex-start`.
    *   `margin-bottom` for `popupMetaRow, .popupTagsRow` increased from `6px` to `12px`.
    *   `margin-bottom` for `popupTitle` significantly increased from `8px` to `32px`.
    *   `ratingTags` gained a fixed `width` of `710px`.
*   **Styling for `popupMetaRow` and dot separator (27/10/2025, 19:19:00 - 19:48:52):**
    *   Specific `text-shadow`, `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `color` styles were added for `.popupMetaRow`.
    *   In the final style change, `.doth` styles were added *within* `.popupMetaRow`, defining its appearance (inline-block, relative position, margins, color, font-size, alignment, height, line-height, width). This `doth` styling corresponds to the `DrawADoth_v2` component implemented in `index.jsx`, even though the component's usage was subsequently rolled back in the JavaScript file.

**3. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\index.jsx`**

*   **Component substitution (27/10/2025, 19:26:32 - 19:27:03):** The `ExternalContentModal` was updated to replace its usage of a generic `InfoGroup` component with the newly modified `PopupInfoGroup` component. This indicates that `PopupInfoGroup` is now the standardized component for displaying media information within this modal.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **27/10/2025, 19:11:12:** Hardcoded `item.rating_tags` updated with more diverse content.
*   **27/10/2025, 19:14:15:** Styling for meta and tags rows adjusted (`align-items: flex-start`, `ratingTags` width).
*   **27/10/2025, 19:15:56:** `popupTitle` `margin-bottom` significantly increased.
*   **27/10/2025, 19:27:03:** `ExternalContentModal` switched from `InfoGroup` to `PopupInfoGroup`.
*   **27/10/2025, 19:31:51:** Introduction of `EpisodeCount`, `SeasonsCount`, `Publication` components and `renderSeasonOrEpisodeCount` logic.
*   **27/10/2025, 19:36:17:** Major refactor of `popupMetaRow` JSX to render new data types with `DrawADoth_v2` separators.
*   **27/10/2025, 19:37:53:** `useSettings` hook imported, connecting `PopupInfoGroup` to application settings for `MAX_EPISODES`.
*   **27/10/2025, 19:43:40 - 19:43:49:** Definition of `DrawADoth_v2` component included and fixed within `index.jsx`.
*   **27/10/2025, 19:48:34:** Rollback of the `popupMetaRow`'s `dothSeparatedItems` rendering in `index.jsx`.
*   **27/10/2025, 19:48:52:** Styling for the `.doth` separator added in `styles.scss` (even after its corresponding JSX was rolled back).
*   **27/10/2025, 19:51:53:** Reversion of `description` text cleaning and removal of hardcoded `item.rating_tags`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Component Refinement:** The `PopupInfoGroup` component is a central focus, undergoing significant iterative changes to enhance its data display capabilities.
*   **Styling Consistency:** Recurring adjustments to `margin-bottom` and `align-items` for row elements suggest an effort to standardize spacing and alignment.
*   **Dynamic Data Presentation:** The introduction of `EpisodeCount`, `SeasonsCount`, `Publication` components, and `useMemo` hooks indicates a move towards richer, more dynamic display of media metadata.
*   **Feature Introduction and Rollback:** The `dothSeparatedItems` and `DrawADoth_v2` feature was introduced, refined, and then rolled back within the `index.jsx` component, but its corresponding CSS (`.doth` styles) persisted. This might indicate an incomplete rollback or a feature that's still under development and temporarily disabled.
*   **Hardcoded Test Data:** The repeated hardcoding of `item.rating_tags` in `index.jsx` suggests active testing and development of how these tags are processed and displayed.

## 20:57:52
The provided log details a series of changes to the `ExternalContentModal` component and its associated styling, all occurring on **October 27, 2025**. The updates demonstrate an iterative refinement process, focusing on enhancing the display of external content information, particularly the platform text, and ensuring proper UI layout.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\index.jsx`**:
    *   **Dynamic Platform Text Rendering**:
        *   **(20:40:15 - 20:40:24)**: The logic for rendering `platformText` was significantly updated. Instead of a single paragraph, it now checks if the text contains a period to split it into two separate paragraphs, improving readability for multi-sentence descriptions.
        *   **(20:44:30)**: The source for `platformText` was made more robust, changing from `item.platform_text` to `item.external_content_data?.platform_text || ""`, allowing for nested data and providing a default empty string.
        *   **(20:54:00 - 20:54:33)**: The `platformText` rendering was wrapped in a `platformTextRow` container and visually enhanced by prepending it with an `infoImg` containing an icon. The icon itself evolved from `externalIcon` to `ic_mes_contorn.svg` and finally to `ic_info.svg` during these steps.
    *   **Content Section Adjustments**:
        *   **(20:40:15, 20:42:44)**: A paragraph related to `hasPaidContent` (`popupNotice`) was removed.
        *   **(20:43:00)**: The display order of the `promoCode` and `platformText` sections was swapped, placing the `promoCode` first.
    *   **Consistent Focus Management**: The `useEffect` hook remained constant across all changes, ensuring that the "btn-open-external" button receives initial focus and focus is restored to a specified element upon modal closure.

2.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss`**:
    *   **Platform Text and Icon Styling**:
        *   **(20:48:00)**: Introduced specific `margin: 0;` for `popupPlatform` and added a `margin-top: 40px;` for the `:first-of-type` `popupPlatform` to manage spacing when multiple paragraphs are rendered.
        *   **(20:50:08 - 20:51:46)**: Styles for the new information icon (`.infoImg`) were introduced and refined. Simultaneously, a `.platformTextRow` class was defined to serve as a flex container for the icon and text, managing alignment and wrapping behavior.
        *   **(20:54:54 - 20:56:17)**: The CSS structure was updated to match the HTML changes, introducing a `.platformTextWrapper` within `.platformTextRow`. This wrapper was styled as a flex column to contain the `popupPlatform` paragraphs, ensuring `margin` properties were correctly applied within this new layout, including the `margin-top: 40px;` for the first paragraph.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **27/10/2025, 20:40:15**: Major refactor of `platformText` logic and removal of `hasPaidContent` in the `.jsx` component.
*   **27/10/2025, 20:44:30**: Update to `platformText` data source for improved reliability in the `.jsx` component.
*   **27/10/2025, 20:48:00**: Initial CSS adjustments for `popupPlatform` spacing in `styles.scss`.
*   **27/10/2025, 20:54:00 - 20:54:33**: Introduction of the `infoImg` and `platformTextWrapper` elements in `index.jsx`, along with corresponding icon source changes (`ic_linkexterior.svg` -> `ic_mes_contorn.svg` -> `ic_info.svg`).
*   **27/10/2025, 20:56:07**: Final structural and spacing adjustments for the `platformTextRow` and its nested elements in `styles.scss`.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Component-Driven Development**: Changes in functionality and structure in the React component (`index.jsx`) directly triggered related styling adjustments in the SCSS file (`styles.scss`), showcasing a tight coupling between the two during development.
*   **Iterative UI/UX Enhancement**: Multiple small changes were made to refine the presentation of textual information and add visual cues (like the info icon), indicating a focus on user experience and clarity.
*   **Robust Data Handling**: The use of optional chaining (`?.`) and fallback values (`||`) for accessing item properties (`item.default_episode?.title`, `item.external_content_data?.platform_text`) is a recurring pattern to prevent errors with potentially incomplete data.
