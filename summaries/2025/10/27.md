# Activity Summary for 27/10/2025

## 8:57:31
The provided code logs detail platform-specific implementations for Tizen and webOS smart TV applications, primarily focusing on application lifecycle management, inter-app communication, and app store redirection. The timestamps indicate these changes occurred on 27/10/2025, around 8:37 AM and 8:39 AM, suggesting concurrent development or a single session of updates across platform integrations.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (Timestamp: 27/10/2025, 8:37:26)**
    *   **Initialization (`initAppTizen`)**: Retrieves Tizen device model and manufacturer information.
    *   **Event Handling**: Attaches listeners for `visibilitychange` and `evExitApplication`.
        *   When the app is hidden, it attempts to pause a `player`, navigate back in history, and stop `webapis.avplay`.
        *   When the app is resumed, it calls `window.AppGlobal.Actions.onVisibilityChange()` and resumes `webapis.avplay`.
        *   `evExitApplication` triggers a graceful exit of the Tizen application.
    *   **App Launching (`launchAppTizen`)**: Provides a mechanism to launch other Tizen applications using `tizen.ApplicationControl` with custom parameters. If the launch fails, it attempts to open the Samsung Store.
    *   **Store Redirection (`openSamsungStore`)**: Facilitates opening the Samsung Content Store to display details for a specific application ID.
    *   The `TizenDevice` function acts as the main entry point, calling `initAppTizen`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\webos\webos.js` (Timestamp: 27/10/2025, 8:39:30)**
    *   **Initialization (`initAppWebos`)**:
    *   **Event Handling**: Attaches listeners for `webOSLaunch`, `webOSRelaunch`, `visibilitychange`, and `evExitApplication`.
        *   `webOSLaunch` and `webOSRelaunch` log details about the app's launch/relaunch.
        *   `visibilitychange` logs the app's visibility state and calls `window.AppGlobal.Actions.onVisibilityChange()` when visible.
        *   `evExitApplication` triggers `window.close()` to exit the webOS application.
    *   **App Launching (`launchAppWebOS`)**: Utilizes `luna://com.webos.applicationManager` service requests to launch other webOS applications. It includes a fallback to open the LG Store if the launch fails.
    *   **Store Redirection (`openLGStore`)**: Attempts to launch the LG Content Store. Commented-out parameters suggest various ways to open the store (e.g., by keyword, contentId, or category), indicating potential past or future implementations for deep linking.
    *   The `WebosDevice` function acts as the main entry point, calling `initAppWebos`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Platform-Specific Adapters**: Both files implement similar functionalities tailored to their respective smart TV platforms (Tizen and webOS). This includes application lifecycle management, event listeners, and launching other applications or app stores.
*   **Application Lifecycle Management**: Both platforms handle application visibility (`visibilitychange`) and exit events (`evExitApplication`, `webOSLaunch`, `webOSRelaunch`), indicating a focus on maintaining app state and behavior during these transitions.
*   **Inter-App Communication/Launching**: Both provide `launchApp` functions (`launchAppTizen`, `launchAppWebOS`) to initiate other applications on the device, often passing parameters.
*   **App Store Fallback**: A common pattern is to redirect to the platform's app store (Samsung Store for Tizen, LG Store for webOS) if an attempt to launch another application fails.
*   **Extensive Logging**: Both files use `console.log` and `console.warn`/`console.error` extensively for debugging and tracking the flow of execution, including success and failure messages for various operations.
*   **Shared Global Action**: Both platforms interact with a `window.AppGlobal.Actions.onVisibilityChange()` function when the application becomes visible, suggesting a unified action handler for visibility changes across different platforms.
*   **Timestamp Proximity**: The close timestamps suggest these changes were made around the same time, possibly as part of a feature rollout or bug fix affecting both platforms.
