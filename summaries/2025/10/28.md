# Activity Summary for 28/10/2025

## 1:23:16
The provided log details recent code changes within a SmartTV application, focusing on platform detection, configuration, and a specific UI component.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\platform.js` (27/10/2025, 22:00:43):** This file was updated to centralize platform-specific functionalities. It imports device handlers for Tizen, WebOS, HbbTV, and Browser, and exports a `Platform` object. This object includes `initPlatform` to initialize the correct device handler based on the detected platform, `initKeyboard` for platform-dependent keyboard navigation, and `launchApp` for launching other applications on Tizen or WebOS. It also integrates `window.PlatformUtils.getPlatform` for platform detection.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platformConfig.js` (27/10/2025, 22:01:56):** This file sets up global application configurations (`window.AppGlobal`) and platform utility functions (`window.PlatformUtils`). Key updates include:
    *   `getPlatform()`: Detects the current operating system (HbbTV, Tizen, WebOS, Hisense, LG, browser) via the user agent string. For WebOS, it dynamically injects the `webOSTV.js` library.
    *   `configurePlatformResolution()`: Adjusts the application's UI resolution (720p or 1080p) based on the window's dimensions and adds a corresponding CSS class to the `<body>`. It includes a `resize` event listener for dynamic adjustments.
    *   `getOSVersion()`: Retrieves the OS version for various platforms, asynchronously for WebOS and Tizen, and provides fallbacks for others.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\popupInfoGroup\index.jsx`:** This React component, responsible for displaying media information popups, underwent several rapid iterations:
    *   **27/10/2025, 22:11:44 (Initial State):** Introduced the `PopupInfoGroup` component to display details like title, description, age rating, duration, and features. It includes sub-components for `EpisodeCount`, `SeasonsCount`, and `Publication` dates, using a `DrawADoth_v2` component for visual separation in a metadata row.
    *   **27/10/2025, 22:12:31 (Functional Change):** Modified the logic for determining `showTag` and `isLive` status. The condition for "live" content changed from `item?.type === "live"` to `item?.external_content_data?.relay === "En directe"`.
    *   **27/10/2025, 22:13:08 (Comment Addition):** Added `/*TODO*/` comments to the `showTag` and `isLive` variable declarations, indicating potential areas for future review or refinement without introducing functional changes.
    *   **27/10/2025, 22:17:53 (Rendering Optimization):** Implemented conditional rendering for the `popupMetaRow` div. This row will now only be displayed if there is at least one piece of relevant metadata (tags, season/episode count, duration, or publication date) to show, preventing an empty row from appearing.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\popupInfoGroup\styles.scss` (27/10/2025, 22:15:42):** This SCSS file provides styling for the `PopupInfoGroup` component. It defines visual properties such as display, flex layout, font sizes, colors, margins, text shadows, and specific widths for elements like live tags, rating tags, and the media description, ensuring a consistent UI appearance.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**

The timestamps, all occurring on **27/10/2025**, highlight a focused development session:
*   **22:00:43 - 22:01:56:** Early changes focused on establishing core platform detection and configuration utilities.
*   **22:11:44 - 22:17:53:** A rapid sequence of updates to the `PopupInfoGroup` React component and its styling, indicating active iteration on a specific UI element. This includes a functional change to live content detection (22:12:31) and a UI optimization for conditional rendering (22:17:53).

**Patterns or recurring elements:**

*   **Platform-centric development:** A dominant pattern is the strong emphasis on supporting multiple SmartTV platforms (Tizen, WebOS, HbbTV, Hisense, LG) and browsers, with specific logic tailored for each, including platform detection, API integration, and keyboard navigation.
*   **Global `window` object usage:** Both `platform.js` and `platformConfig.js` extensively utilize and extend the `window` object for storing global application state (`window.AppGlobal`) and utility functions (`window.PlatformUtils`), which is common in SmartTV development environments for cross-module accessibility.
*   **Conditional rendering and logic:** There's a recurring use of conditional logic (`switch` statements, `if` conditions, and `&&` operators in JSX) to adapt behavior (e.g., `initKeyboard`, `launchApp`, `getOSVersion`) or component rendering (`popupMetaRow`, `showTag`, `EpisodeCount`) based on platform or data availability.
*   **Rapid UI component iteration:** The multiple, quick changes to `popupInfoGroup/index.jsx` suggest an iterative development process for user interface components, involving functional adjustments, minor refinements, and rendering optimizations.
