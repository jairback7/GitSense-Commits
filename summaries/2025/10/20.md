# Activity Summary for 20/10/2025

## 9:15:23
The changes primarily focus on the development and standardization of modal components and their styling, with significant updates occurring on October 20, 2025, between 9:05:24 and 9:13:33.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\popupInfoGroup\index.js`** (9:05:24 and 9:12:46):
    *   Initially defined the `PopupInfoGroup` React component, responsible for displaying detailed media information such as tags, title, duration, age rating, rating tags, features, and a small description.
    *   A significant update at 9:12:46 changed the stylesheet import from `popupInfoGroup.scss` to `styles.scss`, indicating a standardization of styling file names.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\popupInfoGroup\styles.scss`** (9:05:35):
    *   Provided the SCSS styling for the `PopupInfoGroup` component, defining its flex layout, typography, and spacing for elements like the title, meta rows, and description.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\loginError\index.jsx`** (9:07:31):
    *   Introduced the `LoginErrorModal` component. This modal displays a title, text (which can include HTML), and a button. It includes specific focus management, using `nav.focusById` to ensure the button is focused upon modal presentation, crucial for smart TV navigation.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\loginSuccess\index.jsx`** (9:07:39):
    *   Defined the `LoginSuccessModal` component, a simpler modal structure featuring a title, text, and a button, presumably for confirming successful login.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\userModal\index.jsx`** (9:07:46):
    *   Created the `UserModal` component, a versatile modal that dynamically adapts based on `modalType` (e.g., sign-in, register, guest, enter). It retrieves modal configurations from global settings (`window.AppGlobal.Settings`) and features advanced focus management to direct navigation to relevant buttons and restore focus when the modal closes.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\index.js`** (9:07:56 and 9:11:50):
    *   Initially introduced as `ExternalContentPopup`, this component was designed as a three-column modal to display details about external content. It integrates `PopupInfoGroup` for central content info and includes sections for an image, external application details, paid content warnings, and promotional codes.
    *   A significant update at 9:11:50 renamed the component from `ExternalContentPopup` to `ExternalContentModal` and updated its stylesheet import from `externalContentPopup.scss` to `styles.scss`, aligning with the new naming convention.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss`** (9:08:05):
    *   Provided the styling for the `ExternalContentModal` (initially `ExternalContentPopup`), establishing its three-column flexible layout, background, and specific styles for notices, promo codes, and confirmation/cancel buttons with hover effects.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx`** (9:12:53 and 9:13:33):
    *   This is a core `Page` component responsible for displaying various content types. It integrates the newly developed `ExternalContentModal`.
    *   The code shows extensive state management, data fetching from multiple API endpoints (including live content updates with timed refreshes), content filtering based on device capabilities (e.g., live streaming support), and sophisticated navigation/focus handling using custom hooks and global event listeners.
    *   The second entry at 9:13:33 appears to be a re-save as its content is identical to the previous timestamp.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Standardization of Styling Imports:** A clear pattern emerges with `index.js` files in `components/mediaInfo/popupInfoGroup` and `components/modals/externalContentModal` changing their SCSS imports from a specific component name (e.g., `popupInfoGroup.scss`) to a generic `styles.scss`. This indicates a refactoring effort towards consistent file naming conventions within component folders.
*   **Focus on Modal Components:** A large portion of the changes revolves around new or updated modal components, including error, success, user, and external content modals, suggesting active development in user interaction and information display through pop-up interfaces.
*   **Smart TV Navigation Considerations:** The explicit use of `nav.focusById` in `LoginErrorModal` and `UserModal` highlights a strong emphasis on keyboard and remote control navigation typical for smart TV applications.
*   **Live Content Handling:** The `Page` component demonstrates complex logic for fetching and refreshing live streaming data, filtering content based on device capabilities (`isLiveSupported`, `isShakaPlayerSupported`), and updating UI in real-time.
*   **Unified Timestamp:** All logged changes occurred on the same date, October 20, 2025, suggesting these updates were part of a single, coherent development sprint or deployment.

## 10:15:31
The provided log details a series of changes primarily focused on the `ExternalContentModal` component, its associated styles, and a related sub-component `PopupInfoGroup`.

### File-Specific Updates and Significant Timestamps:

1.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\index.jsx`**
    *   **20/10/2025, 9:16:34**: The import path for `PopupInfoGroup` was refactored from a local relative path (`./popupInfoGroup`) to a more general one (`../../mediaInfo/popupInfoGroup`), suggesting a restructuring of the project's component hierarchy.
    *   **20/10/2025, 9:29:51**: The modal's layout was significantly changed. It transitioned from a three-column structure (Image, Info, Buttons + Notices) to a two-column structure (Image on the left, and Info + Notices + Buttons consolidated on the right). An `externalModalOverlay` div was introduced to wrap the main `externalPopup` content.
    *   **20/10/2025, 9:57:04**: The `image` property was removed from the destructuring of the `data` prop within the component, though the `<img>` tag continued to reference `image`, indicating an incomplete change or preparation for a new image handling approach.
    *   **20/10/2025, 9:59:44**: The `generateImageData` utility from `../../../libs/img` was imported, signaling an intent to centralize image processing. The component still incorrectly referenced `image` instead of the newly introduced image generation logic.
    *   **20/10/2025, 10:01:02**: This entry, despite being logged under `src\views\page\index.jsx` path, clearly shows a major functional rewrite for `ExternalContentModal\index.jsx`. The component now accepts an `item` prop instead of `data`. It uses `useMemo` to generate image data (`imgData`) via `generateImageData`, dynamically extracts various content fields (type, title, platformName, etc.) from the `item` prop, and passes a reconstructed `item` object to `PopupInfoGroup`. The `<img>` tag was updated to use `imgData.file`.
    *   **20/10/2025, 10:11:02**: The `useMemo` hook was correctly imported from `react`, completing the functional changes from 10:01:02.

2.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx`**
    *   **20/10/2025, 9:19:30**: This file shows its initial state in the log, importing `ExternalContentModal` and setting up a complex page component (`Page`) that handles data fetching, live content refreshing, user authentication, and virtualization for rows.
    *   **Subsequent entries for this file (9:19:39, 9:56:53, 10:01:27, 10:04:02, 10:07:45, 10:08:17, 10:09:50)**: No functional code changes were observed in these entries for `Page/index.jsx`. They appear to be identical snapshots, possibly indicating frequent saves without material modifications or logging inconsistencies.

3.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss`**
    *   **20/10/2025, 9:23:41**: Initial styling for the `ExternalContentModal`, defining layout, colors, and button styles. It included styles for a 3-column structure.
    *   **20/10/2025, 9:48:54**: Significant style overhaul aligning with the JSX structural changes. The modal's overall dimensions became fixed (`1355px` width, `720px` height), padding increased, and background color changed. `popupLeft` and `popupImage` received fixed dimensions, and `popupRight` was adjusted to fill available space (`flex: 1`). Many font sizes were changed from `rem` units to fixed `px` values. The `backdrop-filter` was removed from `externalModalOverlay`.

4.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\popupInfoGroup\styles.scss`**
    *   **20/10/2025, 9:44:40 - 9:47:01**: During this period, this stylesheet contained duplicated general modal styles (`externalModalOverlay`, `externalPopup`, etc.) that were more appropriate for `externalContentModal\styles.scss`. Minor adjustments to units and colors were made within these duplicated styles.
    *   **20/10/2025, 9:49:10**: All the general modal/popup styles (`.externalModalOverlay`, `.externalPopup`, `.popupLeft`, etc.) were removed from this file. New, specific styles for `.popupInfoGroup` and its internal elements (`.popupTitle`, `.popupMetaRow`, etc.) were introduced, indicating a proper separation of concerns for component-specific styling.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Refactoring for Modularity**: A clear pattern of refactoring is observed. `PopupInfoGroup`'s import path was updated, and its styles were properly isolated. The `ExternalContentModal` itself underwent a structural and data-handling refactor, moving from direct `data` prop usage to a more processed `item` prop, and centralizing image generation.
*   **Styling Consistency and Specificity**: Initial style definitions sometimes appeared in the wrong `.scss` files, leading to duplication. This was corrected by consolidating general modal styles into `externalContentModal\styles.scss` and making `popupInfoGroup\styles.scss` specific to its component. There's also a trend of moving from relative `rem` units to fixed `px` units for certain text and layout properties.
*   **Focused Development**: The changes are tightly grouped within a short timeframe on **20/10/2025** (roughly 9:15 AM to 10:11 AM), indicating a concentrated effort on developing and refining the external content modal feature.
*   **Logging Artifacts**: The numerous identical entries for `src\views\page\index.jsx` suggest potential issues with the logging mechanism, as they record no actual code changes.
