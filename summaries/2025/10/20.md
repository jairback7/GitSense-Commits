# Activity Summary for 20/10/2025

## 9:15:23
The changes primarily focus on the development and standardization of modal components and their styling, with significant updates occurring on October 20, 2025, between 9:05:24 and 9:13:33.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\popupInfoGroup\index.js`** (9:05:24 and 9:12:46):
    *   Initially defined the `PopupInfoGroup` React component, responsible for displaying detailed media information such as tags, title, duration, age rating, rating tags, features, and a small description.
    *   A significant update at 9:12:46 changed the stylesheet import from `popupInfoGroup.scss` to `styles.scss`, indicating a standardization of styling file names.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\popupInfoGroup\styles.scss`** (9:05:35):
    *   Provided the SCSS styling for the `PopupInfoGroup` component, defining its flex layout, typography, and spacing for elements like the title, meta rows, and description.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\loginError\index.jsx`** (9:07:31):
    *   Introduced the `LoginErrorModal` component. This modal displays a title, text (which can include HTML), and a button. It includes specific focus management, using `nav.focusById` to ensure the button is focused upon modal presentation, crucial for smart TV navigation.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\loginSuccess\index.jsx`** (9:07:39):
    *   Defined the `LoginSuccessModal` component, a simpler modal structure featuring a title, text, and a button, presumably for confirming successful login.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\userModal\index.jsx`** (9:07:46):
    *   Created the `UserModal` component, a versatile modal that dynamically adapts based on `modalType` (e.g., sign-in, register, guest, enter). It retrieves modal configurations from global settings (`window.AppGlobal.Settings`) and features advanced focus management to direct navigation to relevant buttons and restore focus when the modal closes.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\index.js`** (9:07:56 and 9:11:50):
    *   Initially introduced as `ExternalContentPopup`, this component was designed as a three-column modal to display details about external content. It integrates `PopupInfoGroup` for central content info and includes sections for an image, external application details, paid content warnings, and promotional codes.
    *   A significant update at 9:11:50 renamed the component from `ExternalContentPopup` to `ExternalContentModal` and updated its stylesheet import from `externalContentPopup.scss` to `styles.scss`, aligning with the new naming convention.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss`** (9:08:05):
    *   Provided the styling for the `ExternalContentModal` (initially `ExternalContentPopup`), establishing its three-column flexible layout, background, and specific styles for notices, promo codes, and confirmation/cancel buttons with hover effects.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx`** (9:12:53 and 9:13:33):
    *   This is a core `Page` component responsible for displaying various content types. It integrates the newly developed `ExternalContentModal`.
    *   The code shows extensive state management, data fetching from multiple API endpoints (including live content updates with timed refreshes), content filtering based on device capabilities (e.g., live streaming support), and sophisticated navigation/focus handling using custom hooks and global event listeners.
    *   The second entry at 9:13:33 appears to be a re-save as its content is identical to the previous timestamp.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Standardization of Styling Imports:** A clear pattern emerges with `index.js` files in `components/mediaInfo/popupInfoGroup` and `components/modals/externalContentModal` changing their SCSS imports from a specific component name (e.g., `popupInfoGroup.scss`) to a generic `styles.scss`. This indicates a refactoring effort towards consistent file naming conventions within component folders.
*   **Focus on Modal Components:** A large portion of the changes revolves around new or updated modal components, including error, success, user, and external content modals, suggesting active development in user interaction and information display through pop-up interfaces.
*   **Smart TV Navigation Considerations:** The explicit use of `nav.focusById` in `LoginErrorModal` and `UserModal` highlights a strong emphasis on keyboard and remote control navigation typical for smart TV applications.
*   **Live Content Handling:** The `Page` component demonstrates complex logic for fetching and refreshing live streaming data, filtering content based on device capabilities (`isLiveSupported`, `isShakaPlayerSupported`), and updating UI in real-time.
*   **Unified Timestamp:** All logged changes occurred on the same date, October 20, 2025, suggesting these updates were part of a single, coherent development sprint or deployment.

## 10:15:31
The provided log details a series of changes primarily focused on the `ExternalContentModal` component, its associated styles, and a related sub-component `PopupInfoGroup`.

### File-Specific Updates and Significant Timestamps:

1.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\index.jsx`**
    *   **20/10/2025, 9:16:34**: The import path for `PopupInfoGroup` was refactored from a local relative path (`./popupInfoGroup`) to a more general one (`../../mediaInfo/popupInfoGroup`), suggesting a restructuring of the project's component hierarchy.
    *   **20/10/2025, 9:29:51**: The modal's layout was significantly changed. It transitioned from a three-column structure (Image, Info, Buttons + Notices) to a two-column structure (Image on the left, and Info + Notices + Buttons consolidated on the right). An `externalModalOverlay` div was introduced to wrap the main `externalPopup` content.
    *   **20/10/2025, 9:57:04**: The `image` property was removed from the destructuring of the `data` prop within the component, though the `<img>` tag continued to reference `image`, indicating an incomplete change or preparation for a new image handling approach.
    *   **20/10/2025, 9:59:44**: The `generateImageData` utility from `../../../libs/img` was imported, signaling an intent to centralize image processing. The component still incorrectly referenced `image` instead of the newly introduced image generation logic.
    *   **20/10/2025, 10:01:02**: This entry, despite being logged under `src\views\page\index.jsx` path, clearly shows a major functional rewrite for `ExternalContentModal\index.jsx`. The component now accepts an `item` prop instead of `data`. It uses `useMemo` to generate image data (`imgData`) via `generateImageData`, dynamically extracts various content fields (type, title, platformName, etc.) from the `item` prop, and passes a reconstructed `item` object to `PopupInfoGroup`. The `<img>` tag was updated to use `imgData.file`.
    *   **20/10/2025, 10:11:02**: The `useMemo` hook was correctly imported from `react`, completing the functional changes from 10:01:02.

2.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx`**
    *   **20/10/2025, 9:19:30**: This file shows its initial state in the log, importing `ExternalContentModal` and setting up a complex page component (`Page`) that handles data fetching, live content refreshing, user authentication, and virtualization for rows.
    *   **Subsequent entries for this file (9:19:39, 9:56:53, 10:01:27, 10:04:02, 10:07:45, 10:08:17, 10:09:50)**: No functional code changes were observed in these entries for `Page/index.jsx`. They appear to be identical snapshots, possibly indicating frequent saves without material modifications or logging inconsistencies.

3.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss`**
    *   **20/10/2025, 9:23:41**: Initial styling for the `ExternalContentModal`, defining layout, colors, and button styles. It included styles for a 3-column structure.
    *   **20/10/2025, 9:48:54**: Significant style overhaul aligning with the JSX structural changes. The modal's overall dimensions became fixed (`1355px` width, `720px` height), padding increased, and background color changed. `popupLeft` and `popupImage` received fixed dimensions, and `popupRight` was adjusted to fill available space (`flex: 1`). Many font sizes were changed from `rem` units to fixed `px` values. The `backdrop-filter` was removed from `externalModalOverlay`.

4.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\popupInfoGroup\styles.scss`**
    *   **20/10/2025, 9:44:40 - 9:47:01**: During this period, this stylesheet contained duplicated general modal styles (`externalModalOverlay`, `externalPopup`, etc.) that were more appropriate for `externalContentModal\styles.scss`. Minor adjustments to units and colors were made within these duplicated styles.
    *   **20/10/2025, 9:49:10**: All the general modal/popup styles (`.externalModalOverlay`, `.externalPopup`, `.popupLeft`, etc.) were removed from this file. New, specific styles for `.popupInfoGroup` and its internal elements (`.popupTitle`, `.popupMetaRow`, etc.) were introduced, indicating a proper separation of concerns for component-specific styling.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Refactoring for Modularity**: A clear pattern of refactoring is observed. `PopupInfoGroup`'s import path was updated, and its styles were properly isolated. The `ExternalContentModal` itself underwent a structural and data-handling refactor, moving from direct `data` prop usage to a more processed `item` prop, and centralizing image generation.
*   **Styling Consistency and Specificity**: Initial style definitions sometimes appeared in the wrong `.scss` files, leading to duplication. This was corrected by consolidating general modal styles into `externalContentModal\styles.scss` and making `popupInfoGroup\styles.scss` specific to its component. There's also a trend of moving from relative `rem` units to fixed `px` units for certain text and layout properties.
*   **Focused Development**: The changes are tightly grouped within a short timeframe on **20/10/2025** (roughly 9:15 AM to 10:11 AM), indicating a concentrated effort on developing and refining the external content modal feature.
*   **Logging Artifacts**: The numerous identical entries for `src\views\page\index.jsx` suggest potential issues with the logging mechanism, as they record no actual code changes.

## 11:15:23
The code changes primarily focus on two React components, `ExternalContentModal` and `PopupInfoGroup`, along with a utility file for image processing, `img.js`. All changes occurred on **20/10/2025**, within a concentrated period between 10:17:48 and 11:08:05.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\index.jsx`**
    *   **10:17:48**: Initial version of the modal, displaying external content with an image, info, notices, and buttons. Image data is generated with dimensions `212x311`.
    *   **10:24:26**: The image dimensions passed to `generateImageData` were updated to `428x544`, indicating an increase in the desired image size for the modal.
    *   **10:33:59**: A new parameter, `'modal-portrait'`, was added to the `generateImageData` call, suggesting a requirement for a specific image format optimized for the modal's portrait orientation.
    *   **11:06:40**: The fallback text `"Aplicació externa"` was removed from the `platformName` variable, making the "Disponible a" message conditional on actual platform data. Descriptive comments for UI sections were also removed.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\libs\img.js`**
    *   **10:33:20**: Initial version of the image utility library, including functions for image proxying (`getImgProxyUrl`), filtering (`removeItemsFromArray`), selecting the best image based on various criteria (`getBestImage`, `getBestImageV2`), and generating image data (`generateImageData`, `generateImageDataFromLiveChannelInHome_v2`).
    *   **10:35:54**: Corrected the `getBestImage` function to filter images by `img.image_format` instead of `img.format` when a `forceFormat` is provided, ensuring correct image selection based on predefined formats.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\popupInfoGroup\index.jsx`**
    *   This file saw the most significant and frequent changes, indicating active development and multiple iterations on its layout and data presentation.
    *   **10:40:18**: Initial basic structure for displaying media information within a popup.
    *   **10:40:57**: Added a CSS class (`popupTitle`) to the `MediaTitle` component for styling purposes.
    *   **10:43:03**: Changed the `description` logic to prioritize `item.abstract` over `item.description`.
    *   **10:48:53 - 10:53:15**: A major refactoring effort occurred, introducing complex logic for displaying metadata elements (tags, duration, season/episode count, expiration, publication) separated by a dot (`·`). This involved creating helper components/functions like `Publication`, `renderSeasonOrEpisodeCount`, and `DrawADoth_v2`. Imports were temporarily changed or removed, and the `LIVE_REFRESH_INTERVAL` constant was renamed to `MAX_CHAPTER`. The `MediaSmallDescription` component's position in the render tree was also adjusted.
    *   **10:57:40 - 10:58:03**: Largely reverted the complex `dothSeparatedItems` structure, returning to a simpler rendering approach similar to earlier versions. `getLogoImage` and its related `useMemo` were reintroduced, then the `item.media_type` display was commented out.
    *   **11:07:57 - 11:08:05**: `getLogoImage` import and its associated `useMemo` were entirely removed, suggesting that the `logoImage` functionality is no longer needed or managed by this specific component.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\popupInfoGroup\styles.scss`**
    *   **10:58:57**: Initial styling definitions for the popup info group elements.
    *   **11:01:10**: Introduced more specific spacing (`margin-bottom`, `margin-top`) instead of generic `gap`, adjusted font sizes from `rem` to `px`, and added initial styling for `.mediaSmallDescription`.
    *   **11:01:25 - 11:02:55**: Refined the styling for `.mediaSmallDescription` by removing `line-height`, adding a fixed `width`, and implementing `webkit-line-clamp: 3` to limit text to three lines, followed by a significant `margin-top` adjustment to `32px`.
    *   **11:07:05**: Added `line-clamp: 3;` to `.mediaSmallDescription` for broader browser compatibility with text truncation.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative UI/UX Refinement**: There's a clear pattern of continuous refinement in the `PopupInfoGroup` component and its styling, indicating an active development process to optimize how media information is presented. The back-and-forth between a complex and a simpler layout suggests experimentation with information density and user experience.
*   **Image Optimization**: The `img.js` file, coupled with `generateImageData` calls, highlights an emphasis on programmatically handling and optimizing image assets, including dynamic sizing, format selection, and proxying.
*   **Defensive Programming with Data Fallbacks**: Components frequently use `item?.field || item?.anotherField || "default value"` to ensure robustness against missing or undefined data, preventing UI breaks.
*   **CSS for Layout and Readability**: The SCSS changes demonstrate a focus on precise layout, spacing, and text truncation (`line-clamp`) to enhance readability and visual appeal within the modal.
*   **Timestamp Clustering**: All modifications happened on the same day, suggesting a concentrated development effort, possibly a single feature branch or focused bug-fixing session.

## 12:15:25
The code changes primarily focus on enhancing modal functionality and improving navigation control, especially within a Smart TV context. All recorded modifications occurred on **20/10/2025** between 11:15:33 and 12:11:58, indicating a concentrated development effort.

Here's a breakdown by file:

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\index.jsx`**
- **Initial Focus and Navigation Constraints (11:15:33 - 11:24:27):** The `ExternalContentModal` component was refined to manage focus more actively. Initially, a `useEffect` was introduced to set focus on mount (first to "btn-cancel", then updated to "btn-open-external"). Subsequently, `GenericButton` components within the modal were enhanced with directional blocking properties (`blockMovementLeft`, `blockMovementRight`, `blockMovementDown`, `blockMovementUp`) and a `dataGroup` attribute (`group-popup-external-items`) to better control user navigation within the modal's buttons.
- **Focus Restoration Logic (11:26:27 - 11:50:14):** A mechanism was added to restore focus to a previously focused element (`restoreFocusTo` prop) when the modal closes. This involved introducing a second `useEffect` hook with a cleanup function. Later, a refactor (which appeared to introduce and then remove a `useRef` for `initialFocusId`) aimed to ensure the correct focus ID was used for restoration. The final state of this segment relies on `restoreFocusTo` directly from props within the `useEffect`'s cleanup, with an empty dependency array.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx`**
- **External Content Modal Integration (11:30:20):** The `Page` component was updated to import `ExternalContentModal` and introduced an `externalData` state variable, suggesting preparation for displaying this new modal. Subsequent entries for this file (11:38:32, 11:40:33, 11:47:14, 11:50:23) were re-saves without functional changes.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\hbbtv.js` and `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js`**
- **Conditional Navigation and Back Key Handling (12:07:01 - 12:07:14):** Both platform-specific keyboard navigation files (`hbbtv.js` for HbbTV and `generic.js` for other Smart TVs) were modified. Vertical navigation (UP/DOWN keys) now includes a check `if(!nav.fixedFocus.isNavigating)` to conditionally allow movement. Crucially, the back key handling was updated to check `if(window.isUserModalVisible)` before attempting to destroy the application or open the `ExitAppModal`, preventing unintended app exits when another modal is active.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\exitAppModal\index.jsx`**
- **Modal Visibility Flag (12:09:55 - 12:10:28):** The `ExitAppModal` component was updated to set a global flag, `window.isUserModalVisible = true;`, when it is opened, specifically for `ModalTypes.LOGOUT`. This flag was initially placed directly in the render logic and later moved into a `useEffect` hook to ensure it reacts correctly to mode changes.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx`**
- **Centralized Modal State and Navigation (12:11:58):** The main `App` component now centrally manages the `window.isUserModalVisible` flag, setting it based on the `userModalType` state and resetting it to `false` when any modal closes (`closeExitAppModal`, `handleOk`, `handleCancel`). A new global action `openCloseSessionModal` was added, and the `handleOk` logic for exiting the app was expanded, particularly to manage user sessions and navigation for "kid" profiles before dispatching an `evExitApplication` event.

**Key Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
- **Enhanced Focus Management:** A significant focus is placed on robust navigation and focus control, particularly for TV interfaces. This includes explicit initial focus setting, directional blocking, and dynamic focus restoration.
- **Global Modal State:** The introduction and consistent use of `window.isUserModalVisible` across multiple files demonstrate a pattern of using global flags to synchronize UI state with navigation logic.
- **Platform-Specific Navigation Refinements:** Updates to `hbbtv.js` and `generic.js` show a pattern of adapting core navigation behavior (`nav.move`, back button handling) based on the visibility of modals and specific navigation states (`nav.fixedFocus.isNavigating`).
- **Modal Interactivity:** The changes reflect an ongoing effort to make modals more integral to the application's flow, handling user interactions, authentication, and application exit procedures with greater control and contextual awareness.

## 13:15:29
The code changes primarily focus on enhancing user interface responsiveness, navigation logic, and the visual presentation of a modal for external content.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`src\views\config\index.jsx`** (Updated at 20/10/2025, 12:16:14 and 12:20:28):
    *   The `BackButton` component's `onClick` handler was modified to prevent navigating back (`window.history.back()`) if a user modal (`window.isUserModalVisible`) is currently displayed. This indicates an effort to control navigation flow more strictly when modals are active. The initial change defined the configuration view, managing settings like audio description, subtitles, autoplay, and parental control, with specific UI filtering for kid profiles.

*   **`src\platform\generic.js`** (Updated at 20/10/2025, 12:19:33):
    *   Keyboard navigation logic was updated to incorporate checks for `window.isUserModalVisible` when handling UP and DOWN arrow key presses. This prevents focus movement if a modal is open. The BACK key handling also now explicitly checks `window.isUserModalVisible` and `window.displayingDidomi` before initiating history navigation or opening an exit application modal.

*   **`src\platform\hbbtv\hbbtv.js`** (Updated at 20/10/2025, 12:19:44):
    *   Similar to `generic.js`, HbbTV-specific keyboard navigation was updated to check `window.isUserModalVisible` for UP and DOWN key movements. The `VK_BACK` key handling also includes this check, ensuring the back action is only performed if no user modal is visible, before attempting to destroy the HbbTV application.

*   **`src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss`** (Multiple updates between 20/10/2025, 12:24:08 and 12:52:57):
    *   Initial styling for the external content modal was defined, including layout, colors, and button appearance.
    *   The `margin-top` for `.popupButtons` was increased from `16px` to `40px` (12:25:04).
    *   A `margin-left` of `5px` was added to `.popupButtons` (12:31:46).
    *   The `border-radius` of `.externalPopup` was changed from `16px` to `40px` (12:52:57), giving it a more rounded appearance.
    *   Styles for `.popupBtn` were removed, indicating a shift to using the `genericButton` component for modal buttons.

*   **`src\components\modals\externalContentModal\index.jsx`** (Multiple updates between 20/10/2025, 12:26:34 and 12:47:01):
    *   The component was updated to display an external link icon next to the "VES A FILMIN" button by adding `icoPosition="right"`, `imgSrc`, and `showIcon={true}` props to the `GenericButton` (12:42:40).
    *   The `imgSrc` for the external icon was refactored to use an imported variable `externalIcon` instead of a direct path (12:46:48), improving code maintainability.

*   **`src\components\buttons\genericButton\index.jsx`** (Updated at 20/10/2025, 12:44:23):
    *   The `GenericButton` component was enhanced to conditionally render an `<img>` tag based on `imgSrc` and `icoPosition` props, allowing it to display image-based icons.

*   **`src\components\buttons\genericButton\index.scss`** (Multiple updates between 20/10/2025, 12:27:11 and 12:50:18):
    *   Extensive styling adjustments were made for the `genericButton`, particularly for the `.btn-external-modal` variant.
    *   Refinements included: `margin-right` for focused states (12:27:41), border thickness reduction from `2px` to `1px` (12:28:39), and specific `RED` focus border color for external modal buttons (12:29:48, 12:30:14).
    *   New styles were introduced for `.imgIcon` to control its size, vertical alignment, and margins (12:44:56, 12:45:40, 12:48:17).
    *   Font properties (size, weight, family) were added and refined for the text within `.btn-external-modal` (12:48:46, 12:49:02, 12:49:41, 12:50:18).

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **20/10/2025, 12:19:33 - 12:20:28**: Key navigation and back button logic across generic, HbbTV platforms, and the config view were updated to manage user modal visibility.
*   **20/10/2025, 12:25:04 - 12:31:46**: Initial and subsequent adjustments to the `externalContentModal`'s button spacing and general layout.
*   **20/10/2025, 12:42:40**: Introduction of the external link icon to the `externalContentModal`.
*   **20/10/2025, 12:44:23 - 12:50:18**: Rapid, iterative changes to the `GenericButton` component's styling, specifically for the new image icon and text presentation within the external modal buttons.
*   **20/10/2025, 12:52:57**: Final cosmetic change to the `externalContentModal`'s border-radius.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Modal-Aware Navigation**: A strong recurring pattern is the integration of `window.isUserModalVisible` checks into various navigation and back button handlers. This indicates a system-wide effort to ensure navigation behaves correctly when an overlay modal is present, preventing unintended actions or focus shifts.
*   **UI/UX Refinement**: There's a consistent focus on improving the user experience through visual and functional enhancements. This includes adjusting button spacing, adding visual cues (icons), and refining font styles, particularly within modal components.
*   **Component-Driven Development**: The `GenericButton` component was made more versatile to accommodate image icons, and these enhancements were then immediately utilized by the `ExternalContentModal`. This demonstrates a component-based approach where core UI elements are designed for reusability and extensibility.
*   **Styling Iteration**: Many `.scss` files, especially for buttons and modals, show multiple, closely-timed changes, suggesting an iterative process of fine-tuning CSS properties for optimal appearance and behavior.
