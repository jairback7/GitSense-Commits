# Activity Summary for 17/10/2025

## 9:42:59
The provided log details changes across two main files within a `3cat_smarttv` project, focusing on core application setup (`App.jsx`) and the side navigation menu (`sideMenu/index.jsx`), all occurring on `17/10/2025` within a short span.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (Timestamp: 17/10/2025, 9:40:45)**
    *   **Core Application Structure:** This file defines the main application entry point, routing, and context providers. It imports a wide array of views, components, and contexts, indicating a feature-rich React application.
    *   **Routing:** Utilizes `react-router-dom` for defining public and private routes, handling user authentication states. Routes cover onboarding (welcome, signup, QR/password auth, add/manage users), main content (home, collections, live, catalog, accessible content, lists, EPG, search), configuration, and detail pages for series/media. A `PlatformRedirect` component handles initial navigation based on the platform (`isHbbTV`).
    *   **Context Management:** Wraps the entire application with numerous context providers, including `AuthContextProvider`, `SettingsContextProvider`, `ParentalControlProvider`, `VirtualizationProvider`, `SitecatalystProvider`, `DidomiProvider`, `BroadcastProvider` (conditional for HbbTV), and `HighlightProvider`, demonstrating a robust state management and dependency injection strategy.
    *   **Global Utilities & Debugging:** Initializes global `window` objects for focus actions, visibility change handling, and application configuration. Includes a `InitDevConsole` function for a customizable debug console and a `BuildInfo` component to display various build and environment details, all conditionally rendered via `window.appConfig.test_app` flags.
    *   **User/Exit Modals:** Implements logic for opening and handling exit and logout modals, including specific navigation paths for HbbTV and non-HbbTV platforms, and user profile management (kid users).

2.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\index.jsx` (Timestamps: 17/10/2025, 9:40:55 to 9:41:30)**
    *   **No Functional Changes Across Timestamps:** Notably, the code content for this file is identical across all six entries logged between 9:40:55 and 9:41:30. This suggests either repeated saves without modifications or a logging artifact rather than distinct functional updates.
    *   **Side Menu Logic:** This component manages the application's two-level side navigation menu.
    *   **Menu State & Data:** Utilizes React state and effects to manage menu visibility (`show_1st_mnu`, `show_2nd_mnu`), navigation state (`navigate_2nd_mnu`), and selected menu items (`selL1`, `selL2`). It dynamically generates menu data (`mnuL1Data`, `mnuL2Data`) based on the active user type (kid or standard) and application settings.
    *   **Global `AppMenu` API:** Exposes a global `window.AppMenu` object with functions to control menu behavior (open/close levels, exit menu, manage focus), allowing other parts of the application to interact with the menu.
    *   **Focus & Navigation:** Contains extensive logic for handling focus within the menu, including focusing specific items and managing the navigation flow (`navigateTo`, `manageFocused`). It also attaches a "Search" option at the beginning of the L1 menu dynamically.
    *   **User Actions:** Integrates with authentication contexts to handle "change user" and "exit app" actions, triggering relevant modals or navigations.
    *   **Styling:** Imports `style.scss` for styling and sets `body` classes based on the current path, likely for page-specific visual adjustments.

3.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (Timestamp: 17/10/2025, 9:41:36)**
    *   **Dynamic Page Rendering:** This component is responsible for fetching and displaying dynamic page content, including home screen data and individual content pages.
    *   **Data Fetching & Live Content:** Implements `getHomeData` and `getPageData` for fetching content. Crucially, it includes sophisticated logic for handling live content:
        *   `refreshLives` fetches "Now Playing" data and updates relevant sections based on timeframes using `checkTimeFrame`.
        *   It sets up an `setInterval` for continuous live content refreshing, configurable via `settingsData.live_refresh_interval`.
        *   Content filtering (`filterChildren`) removes live content or "CANALS TEMÃ€TICS" if the platform capabilities (`isLiveSupported`, `isShakaPlayerSupported`) do not support them.
    *   **Error Handling & Authentication:** Catches API errors, specifically handling "Unauthorized" or "Token expired" errors by redirecting to `/qrAuthScreen` or logging out, ensuring proper session management.
    *   **Virtualization & Focus:** Leverages `useVirtualizedRows` for efficient rendering of rows and `useFixedFocus` for managing D-pad-friendly focus, common in Smart TV applications.
    *   **User Interaction:** Integrates with `UserModal` for user-related actions (sign-in, register, guest, enter) and listens for `menu:navigate` and `evChangeUser` events to reset page state and virtualization.
    *   **Sitecatalyst Integration:** Sends page marks to Sitecatalyst (`sendPageMark`), indicating analytics tracking.
    *   **Ranking Pages:** Contains specific logic to identify and process "ranking" pages (`mes-top`, `mes-top-infantil`), adding ranking numbers to child items.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Global `window` Object Usage:** There is a heavy reliance on global `window` properties (e.g., `window.AppGlobal`, `window.AppMenu`, `window.appConfig`, `nav` for navigation/focus) for cross-component communication, application-wide state, and platform-specific actions.
*   **Context API for State Management:** All files demonstrate extensive use of React's Context API to manage various application-wide states like authentication, settings, capabilities, parental control, and more, promoting a clean data flow.
*   **Smart TV Adaptation:** Recurring patterns like platform-specific routing (`isHbbTV`), focus management (`nav.focusById`, `useFixedFocus`, D-pad optimized navigation), content filtering based on player capabilities (`isLiveSupported`, `isShakaPlayerSupported`), and references to `Platform.initPlatform` and `Platform.initKeyboard` highlight the application's design for Smart TV environments.
*   **User Authentication and Profiles:** The application clearly supports user authentication, guest users, and different user profiles (e.g., "kid" user types influencing menu and home screen data), with dedicated views and logic for managing these.
*   **Navigation Events:** Custom events like `menu:navigate` and `evChangeUser` are dispatched and listened to across components to orchestrate application-wide reactions to navigation or user-related actions.
*   **Rapid Development/Commits:** The clustered timestamps for `sideMenu/index.jsx` (six entries within 35 seconds) suggest a very rapid succession of saves or commits, possibly without actual code changes, or an automated logging process. The entire log spans less than a minute.
