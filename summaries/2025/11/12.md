# Activity Summary for 12/11/2025

## 9:00:29
On 12/11/2025, two distinct components within the `3cat_smarttv` project saw updates.

At 8:11:14, the `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\genericButton\index.scss` file was updated. This SCSS file defines comprehensive styling for a `genericButton` component, including its base appearance, various states, and specific variants. Key updates include:
- Importing shared `colors.scss` and `App.scss`.
- Defining base button styles for `height`, `width`, `border-radius`, `padding`, `font-size`, and `background`.
- Implementing detailed nested styles using the `&` operator for different states and modifiers:
    - `.btn-external-modal` specific styles, including font-family `"Bw 3Cat"` for its `span`.
    - `focused` state styles, which modify `box-shadow`, `border`, `outline`, and `padding`.
    - `RED` variant styles, especially when combined with the `focused` state, which applies `3cat-red` specific colors to the border and `box-shadow` using SCSS variables like `$base-color-3cat-red` and `$base-color-3cat-transparent-red`.
- Styles for `span` elements, `.icon`, and `.imgIcon` within the button.
- Frequent use of `!important` to override styles.

Later on the same day, at 8:57:00, the `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\platformLogo\index.jsx` file was updated. This is a React functional component designed to display different platform logos dynamically.
- It imports `memo` from React for performance optimization.
- The component accepts `logo` and `isKidProfile` props.
- It contains logic to determine the appropriate CSS class for the logo based on these props:
    - If `isKidProfile` is true, it defaults to the 'sx3' logo.
    - It checks if the determined logo key is one of the `alternativeLogos` ('sx3', 'eva').
    - If not, it defaults to `platformLogo-3cat`.
- The component renders a `div` with the dynamically generated class name, implying that the actual logo images are managed via CSS.

A clear pattern across these changes is their origin within the `MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components` directory, indicating ongoing development of UI components for a Smart TV application. Both files are related to visual elements, with `index.scss` handling styling and `index.jsx` handling component logic and dynamic class assignment for logos. The project name "3cat" is a recurring element, reflected in specific color variables and default logo choices. The timestamps, being less than an hour apart on the same day, suggest a focused period of development activity on related frontend components.
