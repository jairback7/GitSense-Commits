# Activity Summary for 12/11/2025

## 9:00:29
On 12/11/2025, two distinct components within the `3cat_smarttv` project saw updates.

At 8:11:14, the `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\genericButton\index.scss` file was updated. This SCSS file defines comprehensive styling for a `genericButton` component, including its base appearance, various states, and specific variants. Key updates include:
- Importing shared `colors.scss` and `App.scss`.
- Defining base button styles for `height`, `width`, `border-radius`, `padding`, `font-size`, and `background`.
- Implementing detailed nested styles using the `&` operator for different states and modifiers:
    - `.btn-external-modal` specific styles, including font-family `"Bw 3Cat"` for its `span`.
    - `focused` state styles, which modify `box-shadow`, `border`, `outline`, and `padding`.
    - `RED` variant styles, especially when combined with the `focused` state, which applies `3cat-red` specific colors to the border and `box-shadow` using SCSS variables like `$base-color-3cat-red` and `$base-color-3cat-transparent-red`.
- Styles for `span` elements, `.icon`, and `.imgIcon` within the button.
- Frequent use of `!important` to override styles.

Later on the same day, at 8:57:00, the `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\platformLogo\index.jsx` file was updated. This is a React functional component designed to display different platform logos dynamically.
- It imports `memo` from React for performance optimization.
- The component accepts `logo` and `isKidProfile` props.
- It contains logic to determine the appropriate CSS class for the logo based on these props:
    - If `isKidProfile` is true, it defaults to the 'sx3' logo.
    - It checks if the determined logo key is one of the `alternativeLogos` ('sx3', 'eva').
    - If not, it defaults to `platformLogo-3cat`.
- The component renders a `div` with the dynamically generated class name, implying that the actual logo images are managed via CSS.

A clear pattern across these changes is their origin within the `MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components` directory, indicating ongoing development of UI components for a Smart TV application. Both files are related to visual elements, with `index.scss` handling styling and `index.jsx` handling component logic and dynamic class assignment for logos. The project name "3cat" is a recurring element, reflected in specific color variables and default logo choices. The timestamps, being less than an hour apart on the same day, suggest a focused period of development activity on related frontend components.

## 10:00:50
The provided log details code changes primarily within the `3cat_smarttv` project's `components` directory, focusing on buttons, platform logos, and the side menu. All recorded changes occurred on 12/11/2025, between 8:11:14 and 9:30:15, indicating focused development activity within a short period.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\genericButton\index.scss` (12/11/2025, 8:11:14):**
    This entry details a comprehensive styling definition for a `genericButton` component. It includes default visual properties like position, dimensions, borders, padding, color, and font. Special attention is given to focused states (`.focused`) and a "RED" variant, applying intricate `box-shadow`, `border`, and `outline` styles. It also defines specific styles for buttons within external modals (`.btn-external-modal`) and includes styling for icon elements within the button.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\platformLogo\index.jsx` (multiple timestamps):**
    This React component underwent significant refactoring in how it renders platform logos:
    *   **Initial (12/11/2025, 8:57:00):** The component dynamically assigned CSS classes to a `div` element based on `logo` prop or `isKidProfile` (defaulting to 'sx3'), with 'sx3' and 'eva' being recognized alternative logos to '3cat'. It was wrapped in `memo` for performance.
    *   **Transition (12/11/2025, 9:06:53 & 9:07:10):** The component began conditionally rendering an `<img>` tag for the 'sx3' logo, directly importing its image asset via `require`. The `memo` wrapper was briefly removed and then re-added.
    *   **Refined Logic (12/11/2025, 9:08:12 & 9:10:59):** The component was further refined to explicitly import `sx3.png` and `eva.svg` directly and use separate `<img>` tags for 'sx3' and 'eva' logos. The '3cat' logo reverted to being rendered as a `div` with a specific class, serving as a fallback. This approach suggests a move towards more direct image management for specific logos rather than relying solely on CSS background images.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\platformLogo\styles.scss` (multiple timestamps):**
    The styling for platform logos evolved in tandem with its JSX counterpart:
    *   **Initial (12/11/2025, 9:05:55):** Defined distinct absolute positioning and background images for '3cat', 'sx3', and 'eva' logos. The 'sx3' logo included an `::after` pseudo-element for a drop shadow.
    *   **Modification (12/11/2025, 9:06:07):** The `::after` pseudo-element for the 'sx3' shadow was removed.
    *   **Consolidation (12/11/2025, 9:08:25 & 9:10:42 & 9:27:49):** Styles common to `.platformLogo-sx3` and `.platformLogo-eva` (positioning, dimensions, `object-fit`) were combined. The specific `background-image` properties for these were removed from the SCSS (as `index.jsx` began using `<img>` tags). A `filter: drop-shadow` effect was applied directly to `.platformLogo-sx3`. Minor adjustments to `drop-shadow` values occurred.
    *   **Cleanup and Experimentation (12/11/2025, 9:29:24 - 9:30:15):** Legacy/commented background image properties were removed from `.platformLogo-3cat`. There was a brief attempt to introduce a `::before` pseudo-element for a blurred shadow effect on both `sx3` and `eva` logos, which was subsequently reverted, restoring the previous `filter: drop-shadow` for `sx3`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\index.jsx` (multiple timestamps):**
    This component, representing a complex side menu, shows several minor updates.
    *   **Comprehensive Implementation (12/11/2025, 9:16:28):** This initial entry showcases a robust React component managing multi-level navigation, user authentication context, application settings, and global menu controls exposed via `window.AppMenu`. It uses extensive React hooks for state and lifecycle management, handles user profile types (kid/adult), and integrates search functionality.
    *   **Dependency Array Adjustment (12/11/2025, 9:17:08 & 9:21:17):** The `activeUser` dependency was briefly added to the first `useEffect` hook, then removed. This indicates an adjustment or experimentation in how the menu's selection (`refreshSelectedOption`) reacts to changes in the active user profile, ultimately deciding against `activeUser` being a direct trigger for that specific effect.
    *   **Subsequent Saves (12/11/2025, 9:23:46, 9:25:21, 9:25:50, 9:26:30):** No functional code changes were observed in these later entries, suggesting repeated saving operations without significant modifications.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Component-Driven Development:** The changes consistently reflect a component-based architecture, with distinct SCSS and JSX files for each UI element (`genericButton`, `platformLogo`, `sideMenu`).
*   **React Hooks and Context API:** All `.jsx` files, especially `sideMenu/index.jsx`, make heavy use of modern React features like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useRef`, `useMemo`, and the Context API for state management, performance optimization, and global data access (e.g., `useAuthContext`, `useSettings`).
*   **Detailed Styling in SCSS:** The SCSS files demonstrate meticulous styling, including absolute positioning, `z-index` management, and advanced visual effects like `box-shadow` and `drop-shadow` filters for interactive states and brand elements.
*   **Image Handling Evolution:** The `platformLogo` component specifically highlights an evolution in image handling, moving from entirely CSS-driven background images to a hybrid approach where specific logos (like SX3 and EVA) are rendered directly as `<img>` tags for more control, while others (like 3Cat) remain as `div`s with background images.
*   **Global `window` Object Usage:** The `sideMenu/index.jsx` component leverages the global `window.AppMenu` and `window.AppGlobal` objects to expose and access application-wide functions and state, a pattern often seen in larger applications for integration or specific control mechanisms.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** The tight timestamp sequence across multiple files, especially for `platformLogo`'s JSX and SCSS, indicates rapid iteration and development, with changes in one file quickly followed by corresponding adjustments in related files.

## 11:00:44
The provided log details changes across three files within the `3cat_smarttv` project, specifically related to UI components.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\genericButton\index.scss`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 8:11:14**
    *   The `genericButton` styles were updated. Key changes include modifications to `height`, `width`, `padding`, `font-size`, `margin-right`, and `background`. Specific styles for `btn-external-modal` and its focused state were added/modified, affecting `margin-right`, `border`, `span` line-height, font-size, and font-weight. The `.focused` state for the generic button also saw updates to `box-shadow`, `border`, `outline`, and `padding`. A `.RED` variant was added, with specific focused styles for `height`, `border`, `outline`, `box-shadow`, and `span` line-height.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\platformLogo\index.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 8:57:00**
        *   Initial version handling `platformLogo-sx3` and `platformLogo-eva` as special classes for the `div` element, falling back to `platformLogo-3cat`.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 9:06:53**
        *   Modified the `PlatformLogo` component to directly render an `<img>` tag for `sx3` logo, using `require` for the image source, instead of applying a class to a `div`.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 9:07:10**
        *   Re-added `memo` import and `export default memo(PlatformLogo)`.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 9:08:12**
        *   Introduced direct imports for `sx3Logo` and `evaLogo` (using `import ... from ...` syntax).
        *   Refactored the component to render an `<img>` tag for both `sx3` and `eva` logos, based on `finalLogoKey`, with `platformLogo-3cat` as a `div` fallback. This simplifies the logic by handling image sources directly within the component.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 9:10:59**
        *   Minor formatting change in imports (single quotes). The functional logic remains the same as the previous significant change.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\platformLogo\styles.scss`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 9:05:55**
        *   Defined styles for `.platformLogo-3cat` (using `sprites_1080p.png` background image) and introduced specific styles for `.platformLogo-sx3` (with `sx3.png` background and `drop-shadow` filter via `::after` pseudo-element) and `.platformLogo-eva` (with `eva.svg` background). The `_background-image` and `_background-color` properties for `3cat` seem to be commented out or unused prefixes.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 9:06:07**
        *   Removed the `&::after` pseudo-element and associated `filter` and `background: none;` from `.platformLogo-sx3`, simplifying its styling.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 9:08:25**
        *   Consolidated positioning for `.platformLogo-sx3` and `.platformLogo-eva` by grouping common styles.
        *   Re-introduced the `drop-shadow` filter for `.platformLogo-sx3` directly on the element (not via `::after`).
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 9:10:42**
        *   Minor change to the `drop-shadow` filter for `.platformLogo-sx3`, specifically adjusting the opacity of the second shadow (from `0.2` to `0.20`). Effectively, no functional change.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 9:27:49**
        *   No functional changes; the code content is identical to the previous entry.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 9:29:24**
        *   Removed `_background-image: url(../sprites.png);` and `_background-color: aqua;` from `.platformLogo-3cat`, cleaning up unused/commented styles.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 9:29:52**
        *   Added a `::before` pseudo-element to both `.platformLogo-sx3` and `.platformLogo-eva` to create a blurred shadow effect, reusing inherited background properties and applying `opacity`, `filter`, `transform`, and `z-index`.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 9:30:15**
        *   Reverted the change from 9:29:52, removing the `::before` pseudo-element from `.platformLogo-sx3, .platformLogo-eva` and restoring the `drop-shadow` filter to `.platformLogo-sx3` alone.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\index.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 9:16:28**
        *   Significant React component: `SideMenu`. Imports numerous hooks (`useEffect`, `useCallback`, etc.) and contexts (`AuthContext`, `SettingsContext`, etc.). Defines global `window.AppMenu` object with menu state and functions. Includes complex logic for handling L1 and L2 menu data, user authentication, navigation, and focus management (using `nav` object). Includes a `refreshSelectedOption` function to update menu selection based on current path and `attachSearchAtTheBeginning` to add a search item to the menu.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 9:17:08**
        *   Added `activeUser` to the dependency array of the first `useEffect` hook, which calls `refreshSelectedOption` and updates `window.__isEntry`. This ensures the menu's selected option updates when the active user changes.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 9:21:17**
        *   Removed `activeUser` from the dependency array of the second `useEffect` hook. The functionality within this `useEffect` (focusing on L2 menu items) likely does not depend on `activeUser` directly in a way that requires re-running the effect.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 9:23:46**, **9:25:21**, **9:25:50**, **9:26:30**
        *   No functional changes in these entries. The code is identical to the previous one, indicating saving without modification or minor non-functional reformatting.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\popupInfoGroup\index.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 10:13:34**
        *   Initial version of `PopupInfoGroup` component. It displays media information such as title, description, features, age rating, duration, and episode/season counts.
        *   Includes a `useMemo` hook to determine `isLive` status and `showWhiteTag` based on `event_start_date` and `event_end_date`.
        *   Introduces helper components `EpisodeCount`, `SeasonsCount`, `Publication`, and `DrawADoth_v2` for rendering specific pieces of information.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 10:14:29**
        *   Modified the rendering logic for `MediaTag`. Instead of a single conditional `showTag && <MediaTag tagType={isLive ? "live" : "white"} ... />`, it now has two separate conditionals: one for `isLive` (`<MediaTag tagType="live" />`) and another for `!isLive && showWhiteTag && item.tag_program?.label` (`<MediaTag tagType="white" tagData={item.tag_program.label} />`). This makes the tag rendering more explicit based on live status and white tag presence.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 10:24:52**
        *   Introduced `UPCOMING_EVENT_FORMAT` constant and imported `format` and `ca` from `date-fns/locale`.
        *   The `useMemo` hook for `isLive` and `whiteTagText` was significantly refactored:
            *   Now uses `event_start_emission` and `event_end_emission` instead of `event_start_date` and `event_end_date`.
            *   The logic for `whiteTagText` when `now < startEmission` was updated to format the upcoming event date using `date-fns` functions.
            *   Removed `showWhiteTag` and replaced it with `whiteTagText` directly in the `useMemo` return.
        *   Modified `MediaTag` rendering to use `whiteTagText` as `tagData` for white tags.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 10:25:33**
        *   Removed `const now = Date.now();` from the main component scope as it was already defined within the `useMemo` hook. This is a minor cleanup.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 10:25:58**
        *   Re-added the `import { format } from "date-fns";` and `import { ca } from "date-fns/locale";` statements that were somehow missing in the previous log entry but were semantically present due to usage. This is likely a correction of an incomplete log entry.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 10:30:15**
        *   Introduced a new local helper function `formatEmissionDate` to handle date formatting for upcoming events. This function uses `toLocaleDateString` and `toLocaleTimeString` with `ca-ES` locale for a more customized output.
        *   The `useMemo` hook now calls `formatEmissionDate` to set `whiteTagText` for upcoming events, replacing the direct `date-fns` formatting.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 10:32:03**
        *   Removed the unused `UPCOMING_EVENT_FORMAT` constant, as the custom `formatEmissionDate` function is now used. This is a cleanup.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 10:32:17**
        *   The `useMemo` hook's dependency on `item.event_start_emission, item.event_end_emission` was changed to `item.date`.
        *   The `startEmission` and `endEmission` values are now accessed from `item.date.event_start_emission` and `item.date.event_end_emission`, indicating a restructuring of the `item` data.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 10:35:01**
        *   Corrected the conditional rendering for the white `MediaTag`. It now checks `!isLive && whiteTagText` (meaning `whiteTagText` is not null or empty) and renders the tag with `tagData={whiteTagText}`. The `item.tag_program?.label` check was removed from this specific tag's conditional as `whiteTagText` directly contains the data to be displayed.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 10:37:36**
        *   No functional changes. Code is identical.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 10:37:52**
        *   The `useMemo` hook was updated again to get `dates` from `item.external_content_data?.dates`. This indicates another data structure change for `item`.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 10:38:01**
        *   No functional changes. Code is identical.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 10:38:50**
        *   Commented out parts of the `isLive` and `whiteTagText` logic within the `useMemo` hook, effectively making the logic for `startEmission` and `endEmission` (and the `isLive` and `whiteTagText` states) always return `isLive: false, whiteTagText: formatEmissionDate(dates.event_start_emission)` if `dates` exist, otherwise `null`. This implies temporary debugging or a work-in-progress state.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 10:39:13**
        *   No functional changes. Code is identical to the previous entry, with the commented-out logic still present.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 10:50:35**
        *   Uncommented the full `isLive` and `whiteTagText` logic within the `useMemo` hook, restoring its original functionality (determining live status, upcoming event text, or no tag).
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 10:50:49**
        *   Introduced optional chaining for `dates.event_start_emission` and `dates.event_end_emission` when assigning to `startEmission` and `endEmission`, ensuring null/undefined safety. Also added comments to explain the logic branches (roja, blanca, nada).
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 10:51:16**
        *   No functional changes. Code is identical.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 10:51:50**
        *   No functional changes. Code is identical.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 10:55:25**
        *   Changed the `now` variable to `nowUTC` which explicitly calculates current time in UTC using `Date.UTC()`. This ensures consistent time zone handling for `startEmission` and `endEmission`.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 11:00:02**
        *   Simplified the `nowUTC` calculation to `const nowUTC = Date.now(); // ms actual`. This reverts the explicit UTC conversion from the previous commit, implying that `Date.now()` (which returns milliseconds since epoch, independent of timezone) is sufficient and the previous explicit UTC calculation was potentially unnecessary or incorrect for the desired comparison.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 11:00:13**
        *   No functional changes. Code is identical.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\popupInfoGroup\styles.scss`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 10:41:06**
        *   Initial SCSS styles for `popupInfoGroup` and its nested elements like `mediaTag`, `popupTitle`, `popupMetaRow`, `popupTagsRow`, `ratingTags`, and `mediaSmallDescription`. Defines basic layout, colors, font sizes, shadows, and margins.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 10:41:35**
        *   Modified the `width` property for `.mediaTag.white` from `174px` to `auto`, and removed its `margin-bottom`, allowing the white tag to size based on content.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 10:41:45**
        *   Re-added `margin-bottom: 32px;` to `.mediaTag.white`, restoring consistent spacing below both tag types.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 10:42:48**
        *   Changed the `width` property for `.mediaTag.white` from `auto` to `fit-content`, which has similar behavior to `auto` but is more explicit about content-based sizing.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Timestamps:** All changes occurred on **12/11/2025**, concentrated within the morning hours (8:11:14 to 11:00:13). This indicates a focused development session.
*   **Component Focus:** The changes primarily revolve around two key UI components: `platformLogo` and `popupInfoGroup`, along with styling for a `genericButton` and the `sideMenu` component.
*   **Styling (SCSS):**
    *   Frequent adjustments to `width`, `height`, `margin`, `padding`, `font-size`, `line-height`, `border`, `box-shadow`, and `filter`.
    *   Use of `!important` is present in `genericButton` styles, often a sign of overriding default or inherited styles.
    *   Comments with `_` prefix (e.g., `_background-image`) appear and are later removed in `platformLogo/styles.scss`, possibly indicating commented-out or experimental styles.
    *   Consistent use of `position: absolute;` for logo components, suggesting fixed positioning within the layout.
    *   `drop-shadow` filters are a recurring theme for visual effects on logos.
*   **React Components (JSX):**
    *   Heavy use of `memo`, `useMemo`, `useEffect`, and `useCallback` hooks, indicating an emphasis on performance optimization and functional component patterns in React.
    *   **`platformLogo` Evolution:** Shows a progression from `div` with background images to `img` tags with direct imports (`require` then static imports), and then back to grouping common styles in SCSS, suggesting iterative refinement of how logos are rendered and managed.
    *   **`popupInfoGroup` Logic Refinement:**
        *   Repeated modifications to the logic for determining "live" status and displaying date/time information (`isLive`, `whiteTagText`). This involved changes in data sources (`item.event_start_date` -> `item.event_start_emission` -> `item.date.event_start_emission` -> `item.external_content_data?.dates`), date formatting, and time zone considerations (briefly using `Date.UTC`).
        *   Development of a custom `formatEmissionDate` function.
        *   Iterative adjustments to how `MediaTag` is rendered based on live status and upcoming event text.
    *   **`sideMenu`:** A large and complex component handling extensive menu logic, navigation, user context, and integration with global `window.AppMenu` object. Changes indicate dependency management and minor refinements in `useEffect` hooks.
*   **Data Structure Adaptation:** The `popupInfoGroup/index.jsx` file shows a clear pattern of adapting to evolving data structures for event dates, moving from direct properties on `item` to nested `item.date` and then `item.external_content_data?.dates`.
*   **Refactoring and Cleanup:** Several changes involve removing unused code (e.g., `UPCOMING_EVENT_FORMAT`, `_background-image` comments) or simplifying logic, indicating continuous code quality improvement efforts.
*   **Language-specific formatting:** `toLocaleDateString` is used with `ca-ES` locale in `formatEmissionDate` for Catalan date/time formatting.

## 12:00:52
The provided log details code changes across several JavaScript (React) and SCSS files within a `3cat_smarttv` project, primarily focusing on UI components and media information display. The changes occurred between 8:11 AM and 11:58 AM on December 11, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\genericButton\index.scss` (Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 8:11:14)**
*   This file defines styles for a generic button, including its default appearance, focused states, and a specific "RED" variant.
*   Key styles: `position: relative`, `display: inline-block`, `border: 2px solid #ffffff`, `height: 54px`, `border-radius: 100px`, `padding`, `color: white`, `cursor: pointer`, `font-size`, `text-transform: uppercase`, `margin-right`, `background: rgba(17, 17, 17, 0.2)`.
*   A nested `.btn-external-modal` class customizes margins and borders, and its `span` element defines `line-height`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `font-family`.
*   The `.focused` state adds `box-shadow` and a `3px solid #ffffff` border.
*   A `.RED` variant for focused state changes the border to `$base-color-3cat-red` and adds a specific `box-shadow` with transparent red colors.
*   Includes imports for `colors.scss` and `App.scss`.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\platformLogo\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps: 8:57:00, 9:06:53, 9:07:10, 9:08:12, 9:10:59)**
*   **Initial version (8:57:00):** Renders a `div` with a dynamic class based on `logo` and `isKidProfile`. Supports 'sx3', 'eva', and '3cat' logos. Uses `memo` for performance.
*   **Updates (9:06:53, 9:07:10):** Introduced an `<img>` tag for the 'sx3' logo, using `require()` to import the image directly, and removed 'sx3' from `alternativeLogos` for the `div` fallback. The `memo` import was temporarily removed and then re-added.
*   **Refined imports and rendering (9:08:12, 9:10:59):** Shifted to direct imports of `sx3Logo` and `evaLogo` using `import ... from ...` syntax. The rendering logic now uses `<img>` tags directly for both 'sx3' and 'eva' logos, with '3cat' as a fallback `div`. This simplifies the logic by not needing `alternativeLogos` array in the `useMemo`. The content between these two timestamps is identical, indicating a save or reformat without functional change.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\platformLogo\styles.scss` (Multiple timestamps: 9:05:55, 9:06:07, 9:08:25, 9:10:42, 9:27:49, 9:29:24, 9:29:52, 9:30:15)**
*   **Initial/Early versions (9:05:55, 9:06:07):** Defined styles for `platformLogo-3cat`, `platformLogo-sx3`, and `platformLogo-eva`.
    *   `platformLogo-3cat` used `background-image` from `sprites_1080p.png`.
    *   `platformLogo-sx3` and `platformLogo-eva` used direct image paths, `background-repeat: no-repeat`, and absolute positioning.
    *   The 9:05:55 version included a `::after` pseudo-element with `drop-shadow` for `platformLogo-sx3` and set `background: none` for the main element, which was then removed in 9:06:07.
*   **Consolidation and refactor (9:08:25, 9:10:42, 9:27:49, 9:30:15):** The styles for `platformLogo-sx3` and `platformLogo-eva` were consolidated into a single rule `.platformLogo-sx3, .platformLogo-eva` for shared properties like `position`, `z-index`, `right`, `top`, `width`, `height`, and `object-fit: contain`. `platformLogo-sx3` retained its `filter: drop-shadow` property. These entries are largely identical, suggesting minor reformatting or saves.
*   **Cleanup and shadow experiment (9:29:24, 9:29:52):**
    *   **9:29:24:** Removed commented-out `_background-image` and `_background-color` properties from `.platformLogo-3cat`.
    *   **9:29:52:** Introduced a `::before` pseudo-element for `.platformLogo-sx3, .platformLogo-eva` to create a blurred shadow effect, then this experimental shadow was removed in 9:30:15.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps: 9:16:28, 9:17:08, 9:21:17, 9:23:46, 9:25:21, 9:25:50, 9:26:30)**
*   These entries show minor modifications, primarily to the dependencies array of `useEffect` hooks.
*   **9:16:28:** Added `activeUser` to the dependencies of the first `useEffect` (for `refreshSelectedOption`).
*   **9:17:08:** The first `useEffect`'s dependency array was changed from `[location, mnuL1Data, mnuL2Data]` to `[location, mnuL1Data, mnuL2Data, activeUser]`. The second `useEffect`'s dependency array was changed from `[navigate_2nd_mnu, activeUser]` to `[navigate_2nd_mnu]`.
*   Subsequent timestamps (9:21:17, 9:23:46, 9:25:21, 9:25:50, 9:26:30) show no functional changes, indicating saves or reformatting. The code remains largely the same, handling menu logic, user authentication, navigation, and state management.
*   The component initializes `window.AppMenu` for global menu state management. It handles L1 and L2 menu data generation (for 'Explora' and 'User' menus, including kid profiles), and manages menu visibility and focus.
*   Includes `useCallback`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useMemo`, `useState` hooks.
*   Imports various helpers, contexts, and navigation utilities.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\popupInfoGroup\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps: 10:13:34 - 11:13:22)**
*   This component displays detailed media information in a popup.
*   **Initial version (10:13:34):**
    *   Introduced `isLive` and `showWhiteTag` calculation based on `item.event_start_date` and `item.event_end_date`.
    *   Defined `EpisodeCount`, `SeasonsCount`, and `Publication` sub-components.
    *   Used `DrawADoth_v2` for separating metadata elements visually.
*   **Refinement of live/upcoming event logic (10:14:29 - 10:30:15):**
    *   Modified `isLive` and `whiteTagText` logic within `useMemo` to use `item.event_start_emission` and `item.event_end_emission` instead of `event_start_date`/`event_end_date`.
    *   **10:24:52:** Introduced `UPCOMING_EVENT_FORMAT` constant and `format` function from `date-fns` (and `ca` locale) to format upcoming event dates. Temporarily removed `tagData` for white tag.
    *   **10:25:33 & 10:25:58:** Fixed import for `format` and `ca` from `date-fns/locale`. Restored `whiteTagText` for `tagData`.
    *   **10:30:15:** Replaced `date-fns` formatting with a custom `formatEmissionDate` function for more specific Catalan formatting (e.g., capitalizing weekday). The `UPCOMING_EVENT_FORMAT` constant became unused.
*   **Data source changes (10:32:17 - 11:00:30):**
    *   **10:32:17:** Shifted the source of `event_start_emission` and `event_end_emission` from `item` directly to `item.date`.
    *   **10:37:52:** Changed the source of emission dates to `item.external_content_data?.dates`. This indicates an integration with external content data.
    *   **10:38:50, 10:39:13, 10:50:49, 11:03:35, 11:04:15, 11:04:40, 11:05:25, 11:05:42:** These timestamps show repeated uncommenting/commenting of the `isLive` and `whiteTagText` logic within the `useMemo` hook, specifically the `if (nowUTC >= startEmission && nowUTC <= endEmission)` and `if (nowUTC < startEmission)` blocks. This suggests debugging or iterative changes to the emission date handling.
    *   **10:55:25:** Introduced `nowUTC` calculation to use `Date.UTC` for comparison, aiming for timezone-independent comparison, but reverted to `Date.now()` shortly after (11:00:02).
    *   **11:00:30:** Removed the `* 1000` from `startEmission` and `endEmission` values, implying they are now expected to be in milliseconds directly from the data source, not seconds. This was then reverted back to multiplying by 1000 in `11:01:20`. The log shows inconsistent application of `* 1000` here.
*   **Duration handling improvement (11:09:47, 11:09:56, 11:13:22):**
    *   Updated `duration` to also check `item.external_content_data.duration`.
    *   **11:13:22:** Refined `showDuration` `useMemo` to handle `rawDuration` as either a number (for `Duration` component) or a string (for a custom `div` display), providing more flexibility for external content.
*   **External Emission Date Formatting (11:41:41, 11:42:30, 11:42:57, 11:46:13, 11:47:42):**
    *   Moved the `formatEmissionDate` function into `../../../../utils/time` and imported it as `formatExternalEmissionDate`. The local `formatEmissionDate` function was removed, and the `useMemo` now calls the imported utility.
    *   The commenting/uncommenting of `isLive` and `whiteTagText` logic continues, similar to previous patterns.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\popupInfoGroup\styles.scss` (Multiple timestamps: 10:41:06, 10:41:35, 10:41:45, 10:42:48)**
*   These updates primarily adjust the `mediaTag` styles within the `popupInfoGroup`.
*   **10:41:06:** `.mediaTag.live` and `.mediaTag.white` set `width: 174px` and `margin-bottom: 32px`.
*   **10:41:35:** Changed `.mediaTag.white` to `width: auto;`.
*   **10:41:45:** Added `margin-bottom: 32px;` back to `.mediaTag.white`.
*   **10:42:48:** Changed `width: auto;` to `width: fit-content;` for `.mediaTag.white`.
*   Other styles for `popupTitle`, `popupMetaRow`, `popupTagsRow`, `ratingTags`, and `mediaSmallDescription` remained consistent.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps: 11:20:29, 11:21:13)**
*   This component renders a modal for external content.
*   It populates `PopupInfoGroup` with various item properties.
*   Uses `GenericButton` for actions like "open external" and "continue to 3cat".
*   **11:21:13:** Removed `showTagsAndDuration={true}` prop from `PopupInfoGroup`, indicating it's now handled internally or has a default.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\highlightPanel\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps: 11:22:05, 11:22:41)**
*   This component displays a highlighted item, potentially with a video teaser.
*   It fetches image data using `getBestImageV2`.
*   **11:22:41:** Removed `showTagsAndDuration={true}` prop from `InfoGroup`, similar to the change in `externalContentModal`.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps: 11:16:30 - 11:47:59)**
*   This component displays general media information.
*   **Initial version (11:16:30):**
    *   Defined `EpisodeCount`, `SeasonsCount` for displaying counts.
    *   Included logic for `showExpiration` based on `unpublished_on` and `isLive` / `isUpcomingEvent` checks.
    *   Renders various media elements: external platform logo, media tags, titles, age rating, duration, description.
    *   The `showTags` and `showDuration` `useMemo` hooks are conditional on `props.showTagsAndDuration`.
*   **Refactoring external live event logic (11:35:37 - 11:45:58):**
    *   Introduced a new `formatEmissionDate` function (later moved to `utils/time`) and `isLiveExternal`, `whiteTagText` `useMemo` similar to `popupInfoGroup`. This logic checks `item.external_content_data?.dates` for emission times.
    *   Multiple instances of commenting/uncommenting the `isLiveExternal` logic were observed, showing iterative development.
    *   **11:38:38:** The `whiteTagText` for `isLiveExternal` was updated to use `formatCatalanDayMonthWithLabelUTC` instead of the more detailed `formatEmissionDate`, indicating a change in desired display format for upcoming external events.
*   **Dependency path updates (11:40:51, 11:45:21, 11:46:39, 11:47:59):**
    *   Changed import path for `formatFullDateWithLabelUTC`, `formatCatalanDayMonthWithLabelUTC`, and `formatExternalEmissionDate` from `'@/utils/time'` to `'../../../utils/time'`, fixing a potential alias issue.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\landscapeItem\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps: 11:55:00, 11:56:29, 11:56:50, 11:58:13)**
*   This component renders individual landscape-oriented items in a row.
*   **Introduction of external content and live event logic (11:55:00):**
    *   Added `isExternal` and `platformLogo` checks.
    *   Incorporated `isLiveExternal` and `whiteTagText` logic within a `useMemo`, using `item.external_content_data?.dates` and `formatExternalEmissionDate`. This is consistent with the changes in `popupInfoGroup` and `infoGroup`.
    *   Conditional rendering of a `platform-footer` with external link icon.
    *   Conditional rendering of `MediaTag` for external live/upcoming events.
*   **Debugging/Iterative changes (11:56:29, 11:56:50):** The `isLiveExternal` checks within the `useMemo` were commented out in 11:56:50, similar to patterns in other files, indicating testing or temporary disabling of that logic.
*   **Import missing component (11:58:13):** Added `import MediaTag from '../../../mediaInfo/mediaTag'` to resolve an undeclared component.

**`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\utils\time.js` (Multiple timestamps: 11:43:42, 11:46:51)**
*   This utility file contains various date and time formatting functions.
*   **11:43:42:** Introduced `formatExternalEmissionDate` function, which formats a timestamp into a Catalan-localized string (Weekday Day | HH.mm). This function was then consumed by `popupInfoGroup` and `infoGroup`.
*   **11:46:51:** The content is identical to the previous timestamp, suggesting a save or minor reformat.

**Key Information & Patterns:**

*   **Dates:** All changes occurred on **December 11, 2025**, within a roughly 4-hour window (8:11 AM to 11:58 AM). This suggests a concentrated work session on specific features.
*   **Components Affected:** The core changes revolve around three main UI components: `genericButton`, `platformLogo`, `sideMenu`, `popupInfoGroup`, `externalContentModal`, `highlightPanel`, `infoGroup`, and `landscapeItem`.
*   **Focus on External Content and Live Events:** A dominant theme is the robust implementation and refinement of displaying information related to external content and live/upcoming events. This includes:
    *   Dynamic rendering of platform-specific logos.
    *   Calculation and display of "Live" or "Upcoming" tags with formatted dates.
    *   Adjusting data sources (`item.external_content_data?.dates`) for event times.
*   **Refactoring and Code Cleanup:**
    *   Moving date formatting logic to a shared `utils/time.js` file (`formatExternalEmissionDate`).
    *   Consolidating SCSS rules for similar elements (`.platformLogo-sx3, .platformLogo-eva`).
    *   Removing commented-out code or unused constants (e.g., `UPCOMING_EVENT_FORMAT`, `_background-image`).
    *   Adjusting prop passing, e.g., removing `showTagsAndDuration` from some components, implying internal handling or default values.
*   **Iterative Development/Debugging:** Multiple timestamps for the same file, especially with commenting/uncommenting blocks of code (e.g., `isLiveExternal` logic in `popupInfoGroup` and `infoGroup`), suggest an iterative development process involving testing and refinement of the live/upcoming event logic.
*   **Localization:** The `formatEmissionDate` (and `formatExternalEmissionDate`) function explicitly uses `"ca-ES"` (Catalan - Spain) for date formatting, highlighting a focus on localization.
*   **Performance:** The use of `memo` in React components (`PlatformLogo`, `PopupInfoGroup`, `ExternalContentModal`, `HighlightPanel`, `InfoGroup`) and `useMemo`, `useCallback` hooks suggests an emphasis on optimizing rendering performance.
*   **CSS Adjustments:** Minor but specific CSS changes for button focus states and media tag widths indicate UI polish and responsiveness to design requirements.
