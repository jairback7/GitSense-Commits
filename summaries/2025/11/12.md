# Activity Summary for 12/11/2025

## 9:00:29
On 12/11/2025, two distinct components within the `3cat_smarttv` project saw updates.

At 8:11:14, the `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\genericButton\index.scss` file was updated. This SCSS file defines comprehensive styling for a `genericButton` component, including its base appearance, various states, and specific variants. Key updates include:
- Importing shared `colors.scss` and `App.scss`.
- Defining base button styles for `height`, `width`, `border-radius`, `padding`, `font-size`, and `background`.
- Implementing detailed nested styles using the `&` operator for different states and modifiers:
    - `.btn-external-modal` specific styles, including font-family `"Bw 3Cat"` for its `span`.
    - `focused` state styles, which modify `box-shadow`, `border`, `outline`, and `padding`.
    - `RED` variant styles, especially when combined with the `focused` state, which applies `3cat-red` specific colors to the border and `box-shadow` using SCSS variables like `$base-color-3cat-red` and `$base-color-3cat-transparent-red`.
- Styles for `span` elements, `.icon`, and `.imgIcon` within the button.
- Frequent use of `!important` to override styles.

Later on the same day, at 8:57:00, the `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\platformLogo\index.jsx` file was updated. This is a React functional component designed to display different platform logos dynamically.
- It imports `memo` from React for performance optimization.
- The component accepts `logo` and `isKidProfile` props.
- It contains logic to determine the appropriate CSS class for the logo based on these props:
    - If `isKidProfile` is true, it defaults to the 'sx3' logo.
    - It checks if the determined logo key is one of the `alternativeLogos` ('sx3', 'eva').
    - If not, it defaults to `platformLogo-3cat`.
- The component renders a `div` with the dynamically generated class name, implying that the actual logo images are managed via CSS.

A clear pattern across these changes is their origin within the `MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components` directory, indicating ongoing development of UI components for a Smart TV application. Both files are related to visual elements, with `index.scss` handling styling and `index.jsx` handling component logic and dynamic class assignment for logos. The project name "3cat" is a recurring element, reflected in specific color variables and default logo choices. The timestamps, being less than an hour apart on the same day, suggest a focused period of development activity on related frontend components.

## 10:00:50
The provided log details code changes primarily within the `3cat_smarttv` project's `components` directory, focusing on buttons, platform logos, and the side menu. All recorded changes occurred on 12/11/2025, between 8:11:14 and 9:30:15, indicating focused development activity within a short period.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\genericButton\index.scss` (12/11/2025, 8:11:14):**
    This entry details a comprehensive styling definition for a `genericButton` component. It includes default visual properties like position, dimensions, borders, padding, color, and font. Special attention is given to focused states (`.focused`) and a "RED" variant, applying intricate `box-shadow`, `border`, and `outline` styles. It also defines specific styles for buttons within external modals (`.btn-external-modal`) and includes styling for icon elements within the button.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\platformLogo\index.jsx` (multiple timestamps):**
    This React component underwent significant refactoring in how it renders platform logos:
    *   **Initial (12/11/2025, 8:57:00):** The component dynamically assigned CSS classes to a `div` element based on `logo` prop or `isKidProfile` (defaulting to 'sx3'), with 'sx3' and 'eva' being recognized alternative logos to '3cat'. It was wrapped in `memo` for performance.
    *   **Transition (12/11/2025, 9:06:53 & 9:07:10):** The component began conditionally rendering an `<img>` tag for the 'sx3' logo, directly importing its image asset via `require`. The `memo` wrapper was briefly removed and then re-added.
    *   **Refined Logic (12/11/2025, 9:08:12 & 9:10:59):** The component was further refined to explicitly import `sx3.png` and `eva.svg` directly and use separate `<img>` tags for 'sx3' and 'eva' logos. The '3cat' logo reverted to being rendered as a `div` with a specific class, serving as a fallback. This approach suggests a move towards more direct image management for specific logos rather than relying solely on CSS background images.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\platformLogo\styles.scss` (multiple timestamps):**
    The styling for platform logos evolved in tandem with its JSX counterpart:
    *   **Initial (12/11/2025, 9:05:55):** Defined distinct absolute positioning and background images for '3cat', 'sx3', and 'eva' logos. The 'sx3' logo included an `::after` pseudo-element for a drop shadow.
    *   **Modification (12/11/2025, 9:06:07):** The `::after` pseudo-element for the 'sx3' shadow was removed.
    *   **Consolidation (12/11/2025, 9:08:25 & 9:10:42 & 9:27:49):** Styles common to `.platformLogo-sx3` and `.platformLogo-eva` (positioning, dimensions, `object-fit`) were combined. The specific `background-image` properties for these were removed from the SCSS (as `index.jsx` began using `<img>` tags). A `filter: drop-shadow` effect was applied directly to `.platformLogo-sx3`. Minor adjustments to `drop-shadow` values occurred.
    *   **Cleanup and Experimentation (12/11/2025, 9:29:24 - 9:30:15):** Legacy/commented background image properties were removed from `.platformLogo-3cat`. There was a brief attempt to introduce a `::before` pseudo-element for a blurred shadow effect on both `sx3` and `eva` logos, which was subsequently reverted, restoring the previous `filter: drop-shadow` for `sx3`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\index.jsx` (multiple timestamps):**
    This component, representing a complex side menu, shows several minor updates.
    *   **Comprehensive Implementation (12/11/2025, 9:16:28):** This initial entry showcases a robust React component managing multi-level navigation, user authentication context, application settings, and global menu controls exposed via `window.AppMenu`. It uses extensive React hooks for state and lifecycle management, handles user profile types (kid/adult), and integrates search functionality.
    *   **Dependency Array Adjustment (12/11/2025, 9:17:08 & 9:21:17):** The `activeUser` dependency was briefly added to the first `useEffect` hook, then removed. This indicates an adjustment or experimentation in how the menu's selection (`refreshSelectedOption`) reacts to changes in the active user profile, ultimately deciding against `activeUser` being a direct trigger for that specific effect.
    *   **Subsequent Saves (12/11/2025, 9:23:46, 9:25:21, 9:25:50, 9:26:30):** No functional code changes were observed in these later entries, suggesting repeated saving operations without significant modifications.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Component-Driven Development:** The changes consistently reflect a component-based architecture, with distinct SCSS and JSX files for each UI element (`genericButton`, `platformLogo`, `sideMenu`).
*   **React Hooks and Context API:** All `.jsx` files, especially `sideMenu/index.jsx`, make heavy use of modern React features like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useRef`, `useMemo`, and the Context API for state management, performance optimization, and global data access (e.g., `useAuthContext`, `useSettings`).
*   **Detailed Styling in SCSS:** The SCSS files demonstrate meticulous styling, including absolute positioning, `z-index` management, and advanced visual effects like `box-shadow` and `drop-shadow` filters for interactive states and brand elements.
*   **Image Handling Evolution:** The `platformLogo` component specifically highlights an evolution in image handling, moving from entirely CSS-driven background images to a hybrid approach where specific logos (like SX3 and EVA) are rendered directly as `<img>` tags for more control, while others (like 3Cat) remain as `div`s with background images.
*   **Global `window` Object Usage:** The `sideMenu/index.jsx` component leverages the global `window.AppMenu` and `window.AppGlobal` objects to expose and access application-wide functions and state, a pattern often seen in larger applications for integration or specific control mechanisms.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** The tight timestamp sequence across multiple files, especially for `platformLogo`'s JSX and SCSS, indicates rapid iteration and development, with changes in one file quickly followed by corresponding adjustments in related files.
