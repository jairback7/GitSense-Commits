# Activity Summary for 13/11/2025

## 0:38:46
The provided log details a series of code changes within the `3cat_smarttv` project, primarily focusing on UI components, styling, and data handling related to live content and external emissions. The changes span from 12/11/2025, 12:34:48 to 12/11/2025, 17:06:26.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx` (12/11/2025, 12:34:48)**: This file, representing a "Live Item Home" component, underwent significant refactoring. It now includes enhanced handling for external content, introducing `useExternalEmission` hook, and logic to display "EN DIRECTE" (Live) or "UPCOMING" tags based on external emission data. It also refines how titles and progress bars are rendered and improves focus management for interactive elements.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx` (12/11/2025, 12:36:14)**: This component, responsible for displaying media information, was updated to integrate the `useExternalEmission` hook for handling external content live status and white tags. It also refined rendering logic for episode/season counts, expiration dates, and media tags, including a commented-out section related to a JIRA ticket (CCMA-2104) indicating removal of "A partir del" functionality.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\popupInfoGroup\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps: 12:36:34, 12:36:44, 12:37:11, 12:43:32)**: This file, displaying media info in a popup, saw several minor iterations. The primary change was the integration and subsequent refinement of the `useExternalEmission` hook to display "live" or "white" tags for external content. A temporary change at 12:36:44 incorrectly used `isLive` instead of `isLiveExternal`, which was corrected by 12:43:32. An import of `formatExternalEmissionDate` was removed at 12:37:11 as it was no longer directly used within the component.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useExternalEmission.jsx` (Multiple timestamps: 12:37:59, 12:39:25, 12:39:45, 12:44:01, 12:44:45, 14:11:28, 14:11:57, 14:12:07)**: This hook, central to handling external live emissions, underwent numerous adjustments. Initially, it incorrectly determined `isLiveExternal` by always returning true within a time frame check (12:37:59). This was corrected to properly evaluate `nowUTC` against `startEmission` and `endEmission` (12:39:25, 12:44:45). There were also temporary comments/uncomments of logic (12:39:45, 12:44:01, 14:11:57) to toggle the active logic, ultimately settling on a full check for both live and upcoming status (14:12:07). Another key change involved removing the `* 1000` multiplication for `startEmission` and `endEmission` within the `useMemo` calculation, implying the dates might already be in milliseconds or that the comparison was adjusted (14:11:28).
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\styles.kids.scss` (12/11/2025, 12:51:54, 12:52:13)**: This stylesheet for the kids' mode side menu saw a minor adjustment. The `background-color` for focused menu options within `mnu-level-2` was explicitly made `!important` at 12:52:13, likely to override other styles.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\landscapeItem\styles.scss` (12/11/2025, 13:06:26)**: Introduced styling for `.tag` elements, specifically for "live" tags with red background, and added styles for `.platform-footer` to display external platform logos and icons, indicating support for external content.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\styles.scss` (12/11/2025, 13:06:46)**: Similar to `landscapeItem`, this stylesheet also added `.tag` and `.platform-footer` styles to visually distinguish live external content.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\portraitItem\styles.scss` (Multiple timestamps: 13:07:48, 13:09:00, 13:09:11, 13:10:47)**: This stylesheet for portrait items received updates for `.tag` styling, including adding `box-shadow` at 13:09:00 (with some commented-out color format info) and slightly adjusting `padding` at 13:10:47. It also defined styles for `.platform-logo` and `.externalIcon` for external content integration.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\simpleFeaturedItem\styles.scss` (Multiple timestamps: 13:20:36, 13:30:50, 13:31:20, 13:34:18, 13:52:55)**: This stylesheet for featured items had its `margin-top` toggled between a fixed value (116px) and commented out (auto) several times (13:20:36, 13:30:50, 13:31:20, 13:34:18, 13:52:55), suggesting active debugging or adjustments to vertical spacing.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.scss` (12/11/2025, 13:36:29)**: Added styling for `&.external-content` within the `.keyframe` class, increasing its height to 265px. This suggests visual adjustments for external content when it's focused.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\focus\scroll\scroll.js` (Multiple timestamps: 13:46:57, 13:47:47, 13:52:46, 14:08:25, 15:39:27, 15:40:40)**: This core scrolling logic file saw minor, repetitive changes. Each timestamp shows the exact same code, indicating either no functional changes in the committed code at these specific points or possibly re-saves without actual modification. The file defines `AppScroll.config` for horizontal/vertical scrolling behavior and methods like `moveToElement_X` and `scrollTo_X_WithTransform`.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\simpleFeaturedItem\index.jsx` (12/11/2025, 13:49:04)**: The `FeaturedItem` component was updated to conditionally render the `BtnFavoriteMemory` based on `isKidsProfile`, preventing favorite functionality for kid profiles. It also included logic for setting favorite status and registering/unregistering focus actions for its buttons.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\prescriptorItem\index.jsx` (12/11/2025, 13:49:20)**: This component now ensures that `rowItems` is empty and only `rowData` is pushed to it for rendering when `rowType` is 'INLINE'. This simplifies content display for prescriptor items.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\genericButton\index.jsx` (12/11/2025, 13:50:51, 14:26:55)**: The `GenericButton` component received an update to its `className` attribute. At 14:26:55, it added nullish coalescing operators (`|| ''`) and conditional string templates (`${props.sliderType ? expand${props.sliderType} : 'expand'}`) to handle cases where `className`, `focusStyle`, or `sliderType` props might be undefined, making it more robust.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx` (12/11/2025, 13:51:00, 14:27:37)**: Similar to `GenericButton`, this component also added nullish coalescing to its `className` attribute for `size` and `sliderType` (14:27:37), making it more resilient to undefined props.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\prescriptorItem\styles.scss` (12/11/2025, 13:53:03)**: This stylesheet received updates to its `.infoContainer` and `.title_program` styles, modifying `bottom` position, `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `width` for visual adjustments.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (Numerous timestamps: 13:56:46 to 16:50:51)**: This is the most frequently modified file, indicating ongoing development and refinement of the main page view. Key changes across multiple timestamps include:
    *   Adding and refining `pageContainerStyle` state (14:03:12).
    *   Continuous updates and comments around the `filterChildren` function, which dynamically removes or modifies rows based on live support, HbbTV platform, and user type (e.g., hiding 'user_row' for kid profiles) (14:43:41, 14:50:47).
    *   Refinements to `getHomeData` and `getPageData` functions, especially around setting `isRankingPage` (16:25:32, 16:43:39, 16:49:05, 16:50:29, 16:50:51). The logic for setting `isRankingPage` was simplified to check `data.slug` or `data.is_ranking`.
    *   Consistent handling of `onMenuNavigate` and `onReset` events for state management and virtualization reset.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (12/11/2025, 14:19:26)**: Expanded the `getRowElement` and `getShowAllElementFocusShape` functions to support additional row types like `LIVE_TV` and `LAST_DAYS`, indicating new component integrations. It also refined logic for `moreRowItemsAvailable` and conditional rendering for 'FEATURED' and 'INLINE' row types.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\squareItem\index.jsx` (12/11/2025, 14:31:08, 14:37:33)**: Removed redundant `data-block-focus-down` attribute application when `isLastRow` is true, indicating a minor cleanup of props.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx` (12/11/2025, 15:11:46)**: This hook now saves and restores virtualization state, including `visibleRows`, `accumulatedTranslate`, `accumulatedTop`, `currentRow`, `rowRefs`, `idToFocus`, and `rowXTranslatePos`, to `VirtualizationContext`. It also includes logic for navigating rows (up/down) and resetting virtualization state.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\sliderRow\index.jsx` (12/11/2025, 15:28:06, 16:21:45)**: The slider row component's logic for `startSliderTimer()` was uncommented at 16:21:45, ensuring that the slider timer starts if no teaser video is present, which was previously commented out. It also manages `videoUrl` and `hideSlidersPicture` based on teaser availability.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\ranking\index.scss` (12/11/2025, 16:37:44)**: Minor stylistic updates to the `.ranking` class, adjusting `width`, `height`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `opacity`.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\portraitItem\index.jsx` (12/11/2025, 16:54:12)**: Expanded the `PortraitItem` to handle external content with `platformLogo` and `icLinkExterior`, and also introduced a `FutureDate` component for items with `is_licensed === false` and `licensed_on`. It also updated the `onClick` handler to prevent action if `isFutureItem` is true and not external.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\exitAppModal\styles.kids.scss` (12/11/2025, 17:04:23, 17:06:26)**: The `height` of `.modal-content` within the kids' exit app modal was increased from `419px` to `444px`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **12/11/2025, 12:34:48**: Initial major refactoring of `LiveItemHome` to support external content and improve focus.
*   **12/11/2025, 12:36:14**: `MediaInfo/infoGroup` integrates `useExternalEmission` and refines rendering logic.
*   **12/11/2025, 12:39:25 - 12:44:45**: Iterative fixes and refinements in `useExternalEmission` hook logic.
*   **12/11/2025, 13:06:26 - 13:10:47**: Introduction and adjustments of `platform-footer` and `tag` styles across various item components (`landscapeItem`, `liveItemHome`, `portraitItem`) for external content and live indicators.
*   **12/11/2025, 13:49:04**: `simpleFeaturedItem` updated for conditional favorite button rendering based on `isKidsProfile`.
*   **12/11/2025, 14:11:28**: Critical change in `useExternalEmission` related to date multiplication, suggesting a change in date unit handling.
*   **12/11/2025, 14:19:26**: `genericRow` expands to include new row types (`LIVE_TV`, `LAST_DAYS`) and improved item filtering.
*   **12/11/2025, 15:11:46**: `useVirtualizedRows` hook gains state persistence capabilities.
*   **12/11/2025, 16:25:32**: `Page` component's `isRankingPage` logic is refactored for clarity and robustness.
*   **12/11/2025, 16:54:12**: `portraitItem` adds comprehensive external content and future date display.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **External Content Integration**: A major theme is the extensive integration of external content. Files like `liveItemHome`, `infoGroup`, `popupInfoGroup`, and `portraitItem` all see additions of `is_external`, `external_content_data`, `platform_image`, `icLinkExterior`, and related conditional rendering logic. The `useExternalEmission` hook is a central piece for this functionality.
2.  **Focus Management and Navigation**: Many UI components (e.g., `liveItemHome`, `simpleFeaturedItem`, `prescriptorItem`, `genericRow`, `squareItem`, `portraitItem`, `genericButton`, `btnFavoriteMemory`) register and unregister focus actions using `registerFocusAction` and `unregisterFocusAction`. This indicates a robust and controlled focus system, likely for smart TV remote navigation.
3.  **Styling for Kids' Mode**: Several stylesheets (`styles.kids.scss`) are present (e.g., `sideMenu`, `popupInfoGroup`, `liveItemHome`, `squareItem`, `portraitItem`, `exitAppModal`). This suggests a dedicated visual theme for a "kids' mode" within the application, with specific color palettes and layout adjustments.
4.  **Date and Time Handling**: Logic for `start_date`, `end_date`, `licensed_on`, and current time comparisons is frequently updated across `liveItemHome`, `infoGroup`, `popupInfoGroup`, `useExternalEmission`, and the `Page` component. This is crucial for managing live streams, upcoming events, and content availability.
5.  **Virtualization and Performance**: The introduction of `useVirtualizedRows` and saving/restoring virtualization state indicates an effort to optimize performance for pages with many rows, preventing unnecessary rendering and improving user experience during navigation.
6.  **Code Cleanup and Refinement**: Minor adjustments like nullish coalescing operators in `className` props (`genericButton`, `btnFavoriteMemory`), removing redundant attributes (`squareItem`), and commenting/uncommenting sections (especially in `useExternalEmission` and `simpleFeaturedItem` styles) suggest ongoing code quality improvements and debugging.
7.  **Data Filtering and Merging**: The `Page` component's `filterChildren` and `mergeData` functions show a consistent pattern of processing API data, filtering it based on various criteria (e.g., live support, platform, user type) and merging live stream data.
8.  **Ranking Display**: Components like `squareItem` and `portraitItem` (and the `Page` component's `getPageData`) include logic to display ranking information, suggesting a feature for "top" or "trending" content.

## 1:38:49
The provided log details a series of code changes within a `3cat_smarttv` project, focusing primarily on UI components, data handling, and styling. The timestamps indicate a continuous development effort on **12/11/2025** from approximately 12:34 PM to 5:06 PM.

**Key Information from Changes:**

**1. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx` (12/11/2025, 12:34:48)**
   - **Update:** This React component for displaying live items on the home screen was refined.
   - **Details:** It incorporates `useExternalEmission` hook for handling external live content. Logic for displaying external platform logos and external live/upcoming tags was added. Title display now includes presenter information for audio media types. Focus registration/unregistration for `id` and `onFocusAction` is managed using `useEffect`. The `navFixedFocusShape` is dynamically set based on whether the content is external.

**2. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx` (12/11/2025, 12:36:14)**
   - **Update:** The `InfoGroup` component, responsible for displaying media information (tags, title, description, duration, season/episode counts), was updated.
   - **Details:** Introduced the `useExternalEmission` hook to determine `isLiveExternal` and `whiteTagText` for displaying relevant tags for external content. It includes conditional rendering for external platform logos. A commented-out section indicates the removal of "A partir del" (From) functionality, likely a part of JIRA CCMA-2104. Logic for `title` and `description` derivation was adjusted for live and audio content.

**3. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\popupInfoGroup\index.jsx` (12/11/2025, 12:36:34 - 12/11/2025, 12:43:32)**
   - **Update:** This component for displaying media information in a popup context saw multiple, rapid changes.
   - **Details:** Initial changes included importing `formatExternalEmissionDate`. Subsequent modifications primarily involved changing `isLiveExternal` to `isLive` (12:36:44), then back to `isLiveExternal` (12:43:32), suggesting iterative testing or quick reverts related to the `useExternalEmission` hook. The overall structure for displaying tags, season/episode counts, duration, and publication dates remains consistent, utilizing the `useExternalEmission` hook.

**4. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useExternalEmission.jsx` (12/11/2025, 12:37:59 - 12/11/2025, 14:12:07)**
   - **Update:** This hook, central to handling external live emission data, underwent several revisions.
   - **Details:**
     - **12:37:59:** Initially implemented to check if current time is within `startEmission` and `endEmission` to set `isLiveExternal` to true, otherwise it would set `whiteTagText` based on `event_start_emission`. There was commented-out code for handling `nowUTC < startEmission`.
     - **12:39:25:** The commented-out code for `nowUTC >= startEmission && nowUTC <= endEmission` was uncommented, and the subsequent `if (nowUTC < startEmission)` block was also uncommented, ensuring full logic for both live and upcoming external events.
     - **12:39:45:** The `if (nowUTC >= startEmission && nowUTC <= endEmission)` block was commented out, leaving only the upcoming event logic.
     - **12:44:01:** The `if (nowUTC < startEmission)` block was commented out, leaving only a default return value. This suggests further testing/refinement where the `isLiveExternal` was always `true` regardless of time.
     - **12:44:45:** The `if (nowUTC >= startEmission && nowUTC <= endEmission)` block was re-enabled, and the upcoming event logic was also re-enabled, restoring the complete original logic for live and upcoming events.
     - **14:11:28:** The `startEmission` and `endEmission` values were changed from `dates.event_start_emission * 1000` to `dates.event_start_emission`, implying that the `event_start_emission` and `event_end_emission` fields are now expected to be in milliseconds or a different unit that doesn't require multiplication by 1000.
     - **14:11:57:** The `if (nowUTC < startEmission)` block was commented out again.
     - **14:12:07:** The `if (nowUTC < startEmission)` block was re-enabled, again restoring the full logic, confirming the pattern of frequent toggling or minor adjustments to the emission date handling.

**5. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\styles.kids.scss` (12/11/2025, 12:51:54 - 12/11/2025, 12:52:13)**
   - **Update:** Minor styling adjustments for kid-mode specific side menu elements.
   - **Details:** A `!important` rule was added to the `background-color` for `.mnu-op.focused` within `.mnu-level-2`, changing from `$base-color-3cat-kid-royal-purple` to `$base-color-3cat-kid-royal-purple !important`, ensuring style override.

**6. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\landscapeItem\styles.scss` (12/11/2025, 13:06:26)**
   - **Update:** Styling for `landscapeItem` components.
   - **Details:** The `tag` element's line-height was adjusted from `18px` to `24px`. The `title` and `series-title` classes received `ellipsis-two-lines` style, but with `-webkit-line-clamp: 1;` and `line-clamp: 1;`, overriding the generic `-webkit-line-clamp: 2;` in the `.focused` state for `title`.

**7. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\styles.scss` (12/11/2025, 13:06:46)**
   - **Update:** Styling for `liveItemHome` components.
   - **Details:** Similar to `landscapeItem`, the `liveItemHome` tag's `line-height` was adjusted. The `title` element now explicitly limits lines to one using `-webkit-line-clamp: 1;` and `line-clamp: 1;` when focused, overriding a general `ellipsis-two-lines` definition (which allows two lines) at the bottom of the file.

**8. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\portraitItem\styles.scss` (12/11/2025, 13:07:48 - 12/11/2025, 13:10:47)**
   - **Update:** Styling for `portraitItem` components.
   - **Details:**
     - **13:07:48:** Initial style for `portraitItem`'s `tag` element sets padding, font, and positioning.
     - **13:09:00:** A `box-shadow` property with multiple shadow layers was added to the `tag` class, along with commented text discussing "Colores Formato de color Hex Colores de fondo transversal/0 Colores transversal/100 Exportar". This looks like metadata or notes left during styling work.
     - **13:09:11:** The commented text was removed, keeping only the `box-shadow` property.
     - **13:10:47:** The `padding` for the `tag` class was slightly adjusted from `4px 8px` to `3px 8px`.

**9. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\simpleFeaturedItem\styles.scss` (12/11/2025, 13:20:36 - 12/11/2025, 13:34:18)**
   - **Update:** Styling for `simpleFeaturedItem` components.
   - **Details:** The `margin-top` property for `simpleFeaturedItem` was toggled between commented-out (`//margin-top: 116px;`) and active (`margin-top: 116px;`) several times, indicating experimentation with vertical positioning for this featured item.

**10. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.scss` (12/11/2025, 13:36:29)**
    - **Update:** Styling for fixed focus shapes.
    - **Details:** The `.keyframe.external-content .inner` selector was added, setting its height to `265px`, likely to accommodate the extra height introduced by external content footers.

**11. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\focus\scroll\scroll.js` (12/11/2025, 13:46:57 - 12/11/2025, 15:40:40)**
    - **Update:** This JavaScript file for managing scroll behavior, particularly horizontal scrolling, saw multiple identical updates.
    - **Details:** All entries for this file are identical, suggesting either redundant saves, or a system saving without actual content changes, or a repeated build process that touches this file without modifying it. The content includes configuration for horizontal and vertical scrolling, `setFixed` function, `getElementsByClasses`, `resetAllInViewport`, `get_SCROLLABLE_Child`, `moveToElement_X`, `scrollTo_X`, `scrollTo_X_WithTransform`, and `scroll_Reset_X_WithTransform`.

**12. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\simpleFeaturedItem\index.jsx` (12/11/2025, 13:49:04)**
    - **Update:** Logic for the `FeaturedItem` component was updated.
    - **Details:** A `useState` hook `[itemData, setItemData]` was added, and a `useEffect` now updates `itemData.isFavorite` when `isFavorite` changes. This suggests an attempt to attach the favorite status directly to a local copy of the item data within the component. A `console.log` for `isFavorite` and `itemData` was also added. The `BtnFavorite` component was also changed to `BtnFavoriteMemory`, and conditional rendering `!isKidsProfile` was added around it.

**13. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\prescriptorItem\index.jsx` (12/11/2025, 13:49:20)**
    - **Update:** The `PrescriptorItem` component, likely for showcasing recommended content, was adjusted.
    - **Details:** The `onClick` handler for the `GenericButton` now directly calls `navFunction(item)` instead of a hardcoded `() => {}`. Focus registration was also updated to check `origin !== 'mouse'` before calling `onFocusAction`.

**14. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\genericButton\index.jsx` (12/11/2025, 13:50:51 - 12/11/2025, 14:26:55)**
    - **Update:** Updates to the `GenericButton` component.
    - **Details:** The `className` attribute was made more robust to handle undefined `props.className` and `props.focusStyle` using `|| ''`. The `expand` class was also changed from `expand${props.sliderType}` to `props.sliderType ? expand${props.sliderType} : 'expand'`, ensuring `expand` is always present even if `sliderType` is not defined.

**15. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx` (12/11/2025, 13:51:00 - 12/11/2025, 14:27:37)**
    - **Update:** The `BtnFavorite` (renamed `BtnFavoriteMemory` in `simpleFeaturedItem` import) component logic and styling were updated.
    - **Details:**
      - **13:51:00:** Includes a `refClicked` to manage focus after a click. The logic for adding/removing favorites now consistently uses `item?.default_episode?.id` or `item?.id` and similarly for `collection`. It also contains `console.log` statements for debugging.
      - **14:27:37:** Similar to `genericButton`, the `size` prop's class was made more robust (`${size || ''}`) and the `expand` class also became conditional (`props.sliderType ? expand${props.sliderType} : 'expand'`).

**16. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\prescriptorItem\styles.scss` (12/11/2025, 13:53:03)**
    - **Update:** Styling for `prescriptorItem`.
    - **Details:** `margin-top: 116px;` was commented out. `infoContainer`'s `bottom` property changed from `59px` to `164px`. A new style was added for `.infoContainer .title_program` to set font size, weight, and width.

**17. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (12/11/2025, 13:56:46 - 12/11/2025, 16:50:51)**
    - **Update:** The `Page` component, a core view, underwent numerous, frequent updates, especially related to data fetching, live content refreshing, and page state management.
    - **Details:**
      - **Consistent changes across many timestamps:**
        - **`filterChildren` function:** Repeatedly ensures `filterChildren` logic is applied to `pageData` or `homeDataRef.current`. This function filters out items based on live support, shaka player support, HBBTV platform restrictions (no external content), and for kid profiles (no 'user_row' collection).
        - **`getHomeData` and `getPageData`:** These functions are responsible for fetching data. There are frequent adjustments around how `setIsRankingPage` is set.
        - **`useEffect` hooks for reset and navigation:** These hooks are consistently set up to handle menu navigation, user changes, and to reset various state variables (`pageData`, `isLoading`, `fixedFocus`, `virtualizationState`, `homeDataRef`).
      - **Specific changes:**
        - **14:03:12:** `pageContainerStyle` state added.
        - **14:43:41:** `filterChildren` adds a condition to exclude `user_row` items for `KID` user types.
        - **14:47:37:** In `getHomeData`, `setPageData` is updated to apply `filterChildren` directly to the `data` before setting state.
        - **16:25:32 - 16:43:54:** `setIsRankingPage` logic is refined. Initially, it was conditionally set based on `data.slug` or `data.is_ranking`. At 16:25:32, it explicitly sets `setIsRankingPage(fasle)` in the `else` block for `getPageData`. At 16:43:39, `data.is_ranking` is added to the condition. At 16:49:05, the `data.children.forEach` loop to add `ranking` property is commented out, indicating a change in how ranking is determined or applied to children.
        - **16:50:29:** The `setIsRankingPage` logic in `getPageData` is simplified to a direct boolean assignment.
        - **16:50:51:** The `useEffect` cleanup for `evChangeUser` was changed to `document.addEventListener("evChangeUser", onReset);` which might be a typo (should be `removeEventListener`). This line appears consistently duplicated in `useEffect`'s return statement.

**18. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx` (12/11/2025, 15:11:46)**
    - **Update:** This hook for managing virtualized rows was implemented/modified.
    - **Details:** It uses `useVirtualizationContext` to persist and retrieve row state. Contains logic for `handleRowNavigation` (up/down), `resetVirtualization`, `saveVirtualization`, and `removeVirtualizationState`. The navigation logic handles scrolling and updating `visibleRows`, `accumulatedTranslate`, `accumulatedTop`, and `currentRow`.

**19. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (12/11/2025, 14:19:26)**
    - **Update:** This generic row component dynamically renders different item types.
    - **Details:** Expanded the `getRowElement` and `getShowAllElementFocusShape` functions to include new item types like `LIVE_TV` and `LAST_DAYS`. The `generateShoAllElement` function now includes `onFocusAction?.(null)` for mouse-over events. `isExternalRow` check was added, and an HBBTV platform check was introduced to filter out external content. `item.media_type === 'audio'` conditional rendering for `showAudioIcon` was also added.

**20. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\squareItem\index.jsx` (12/11/2025, 14:31:08 - 12/11/2025, 14:37:33)**
    - **Update:** The `SquareItem` component.
    - **Details:** In the `div` element's props, `...(isLastRow && { 'data-block-focus-down': true })` was duplicated at 14:31:08, then one instance was removed at 14:37:33, indicating a small cleanup.

**21. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\sliderRow\index.jsx` (12/11/2025, 15:28:06 - 12/11/2025, 16:21:45)**
    - **Update:** The `SliderRow` component for carousels.
    - **Details:** This component was modified to handle video teasers (`SimplePlayer`).
      - **15:28:06:** Logic for `videoUrl`, `hideSlidersPicture`, and `SLIDER_TEASER_ENABLED` was introduced. The `useEffect` now focuses on the first slider item if `window.AppGlobal.Slider.wasSliderRowRendered` is false. Teaser video playback (`whenFinish`, `onPlaybackStarted`, `onError`) is integrated, and a `startSliderTimer` is called if no video is present or an error occurs.
      - **16:21:45:** The condition `if(gotVideo && SLIDER_TEASER_ENABLED)` now correctly triggers the video playback logic, and the `else` block (`startSliderTimer()`) is called if no video is present, ensuring a fallback for the slider movement.

**22. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\ranking\index.scss` (12/11/2025, 16:37:44)**
    - **Update:** Styling for `ranking` display.
    - **Details:** The `ranking` class received an `opacity: 0.9;` property.

**23. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\portraitItem\index.jsx` (12/11/2025, 16:54:12)**
    - **Update:** The `PortraitItem` component was further enhanced.
    - **Details:** Added conditional rendering for an external platform logo in the footer section, showing `icLinkExterior`. Logic for `isFutureItem` (not licensed) now prevents `onClick` and instead displays a `FutureDate` label. `onFocusAction` now includes `origin !== 'mouse'` check.

**24. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\exitAppModal\styles.kids.scss` (12/11/2025, 17:04:23 - 12/11/2025, 17:06:26)**
    - **Update:** Styling for the kid-mode exit app modal.
    - **Details:** The `height` of `.modal-content` was increased from `419px` to `444px`, affecting the modal's vertical size.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focus Management:** Frequent use of `registerFocusAction` and `unregisterFocusAction` in `useEffect` hooks across multiple components (`LiveItemHome`, `SimpleFeaturedItem`, `PrescriptorItem`, `GenericRow`, `SquareItem`, `PortraitItem`). This highlights a robust focus management system, likely for remote control navigation in a Smart TV environment.
*   **External Content Integration:** A consistent theme is the integration and styling of external content. Many components (`LiveItemHome`, `InfoGroup`, `PopupInfoGroup`, `FixedFocus`, `GenericRow`, `PortraitItem`) include logic for `is_external`, `external_content_data`, and platform logos, indicating a feature to display content from external providers. The `useExternalEmission` hook is central to this.
*   **Kid Mode Styling:** Dedicated `.kids.scss` files (`styles.kids.scss`, `index.kids.scss`) and `kid-mode` classes are present, with specific color palettes (`$base-color-3cat-kid-deep-purple`, `$base-color-3cat-kid-white`, etc.) and style adjustments, confirming a distinct user interface for children.
*   **Live Content Handling:** Components like `LiveItemHome` and the `Page` view have extensive logic for handling live streams, including refreshing "now playing" data, merging it with existing data, and filtering based on live support capabilities. The `live_refresh_interval` setting is key here.
*   **Data Virtualization and Caching:** The `useVirtualizedRows` hook and the use of `window.AppGlobal.ApiMemory.functions.removeSlug('FAVORITES')` suggest an effort to optimize performance by virtualizing rows and managing API data caching, especially for large datasets or frequently accessed content.
*   **Styling Refinements:** Numerous small adjustments to CSS properties like `line-height`, `padding`, `box-shadow`, and `margin-top` suggest iterative visual refinements and responsive design considerations. The use of `!important` in some CSS rules indicates a need to override existing styles.
*   **Debugging and Logging:** Presence of `console.log` statements (e.g., in `scroll.js`, `simpleFeaturedItem`, `btnFavoriteMemory`, `SliderRow`) indicates active debugging during development.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Extensive use of conditional rendering (e.g., `isExternal`, `isKidsProfile`, `item.media_type === 'audio'`, `isLiveSupportedRef.current`) to adapt UI and functionality based on data, user type, and device capabilities.
*   **Use of `useMemo` and `useRef`:** These React hooks are heavily utilized for performance optimization (memoizing expensive calculations, preventing unnecessary re-renders) and retaining mutable values across renders without causing re-renders, respectively.
