*   **Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Deployment**: GCS is the chosen platform for deploying hosted web applications, with a clear convention for environment-specific buckets.

## 12:47:46
The `package.json` file for the `3cat_smarttv` project, last updated on `28/11/2025, 7:51:58`, defines a comprehensive set of scripts and dependencies for building, developing, packaging, and deploying smart TV applications targeting webOS, Tizen, SmartTV, and HbbTV platforms. The project's internal version is `0.9.4`, build `319`, and its internal date is `2025-11-13 21:13:34`.

**Key File-Specific Updates and Patterns:**

*   **Version Management:** The `scripts` section includes a dedicated "UPGRADE" category with scripts (`check-versions.js`, `check-build-number.js`, `check-date.js`, `update-env-from-package.js`) to programmatically update the project's version, build number, date, and environment variables, indicating a structured release process.
*   **Development and Build Tooling:** `Vite` is extensively used for local development, building, and previewing applications across various environments (`development`, `preproduction`, `production`) and specific modes (e.g., `dummy`, `webos`, `tizen`, `smarttv`, `hbbtv`). This demonstrates a modern JavaScript build pipeline.
*   **Platform-Specific Builds and Packaging:** There are distinct build commands for different platforms (`webos`, `tizen`, `smarttv`, `hbbtv`) and packaging scripts (`package-launcher-apps.cjs`) for "launcher apps" on webOS and Tizen. A "TODO" section exists for "embedded apps," indicating future development plans.
*   **Hosted Webapp Deployment:** The project supports building and deploying hosted web applications (`build:smarttv:hosted_webapp`, `build:hbbtv:hosted_webapp`) to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets (`gs://smartv-dev`, `gs://hbbtv-dev`, etc.) using `gsutil` commands. These deployments apply a `Cache-Control: max-age=5` header. This pattern is consistently applied across development, preproduction, and production environments for both SmartTV and HbbTV.
*   **Script Organization:** The `scripts` section is exceptionally well-organized with descriptive comments categorizing different functionalities (e.g., "LOCAL DEVELOPMENT MODES", "BASE DEVICE BUILDS", "DEVICE PACKAGING"). This aids in understanding the project's operational workflows.
*   **Dependency Stack:** Core dependencies include React, React Router, `whatwg-fetch` for network requests, `youboralib` for video analytics, and `jwt-decode`. Development dependencies feature Vite, ESLint for linting, Sass for styling, `dotenv` for environment variables, and various utility libraries like `lodash` and `uuid`.
*   **Recurring Elements:** The pervasive use of `dev`, `pre` (or `preproduction`), and `prod` (or `production`/`pro`) modes for builds, packaging, and deployments is a strong recurring pattern. Additionally, many commands are grouped into `all` scripts (e.g., `package:launcher_app:webos:all`, `build:hosted_webapp:all`) to simplify running multiple related tasks.
