The `package.json` file for the `3cat_smarttv` project, last updated on `28/11/2025, 7:51:58`, defines a comprehensive set of scripts and dependencies for building, developing, packaging, and deploying smart TV applications targeting webOS, Tizen, SmartTV, and HbbTV platforms. The project's internal version is `0.9.4`, build `319`, and its internal date is `2025-11-13 21:13:34`.

**Key File-Specific Updates and Patterns:**

*   **Version Management:** The `scripts` section includes a dedicated "UPGRADE" category with scripts (`check-versions.js`, `check-build-number.js`, `check-date.js`, `update-env-from-package.js`) to programmatically update the project's version, build number, date, and environment variables, indicating a structured release process.
*   **Development and Build Tooling:** `Vite` is extensively used for local development, building, and previewing applications across various environments (`development`, `preproduction`, `production`) and specific modes (e.g., `dummy`, `webos`, `tizen`, `smarttv`, `hbbtv`). This demonstrates a modern JavaScript build pipeline.
*   **Platform-Specific Builds and Packaging:** There are distinct build commands for different platforms (`webos`, `tizen`, `smarttv`, `hbbtv`) and packaging scripts (`package-launcher-apps.cjs`) for "launcher apps" on webOS and Tizen. A "TODO" section exists for "embedded apps," indicating future development plans.
*   **Hosted Webapp Deployment:** The project supports building and deploying hosted web applications (`build:smarttv:hosted_webapp`, `build:hbbtv:hosted_webapp`) to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets (`gs://smartv-dev`, `gs://hbbtv-dev`, etc.) using `gsutil` commands. These deployments apply a `Cache-Control: max-age=5` header. This pattern is consistently applied across development, preproduction, and production environments for both SmartTV and HbbTV.
*   **Script Organization:** The `scripts` section is exceptionally well-organized with descriptive comments categorizing different functionalities (e.g., "LOCAL DEVELOPMENT MODES", "BASE DEVICE BUILDS", "DEVICE PACKAGING"). This aids in understanding the project's operational workflows.
*   **Dependency Stack:** Core dependencies include React, React Router, `whatwg-fetch` for network requests, `youboralib` for video analytics, and `jwt-decode`. Development dependencies feature Vite, ESLint for linting, Sass for styling, `dotenv` for environment variables, and various utility libraries like `lodash` and `uuid`.

    *   **Deployment:** `gsutil` commands are used to deploy the built hosted web applications to specific Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets (`gs://smartv-dev`, `gs://hbbtv-pre`, etc.) for each platform and environment, with a `Cache-Control: max-age=5` header set.
*   **Dependencies:** Key runtime dependencies include `react`, `react-dom`, `react-router-dom`, `whatwg-fetch`, `youboralib` (likely for analytics), and `jwt-decode`.
*   **Dev Dependencies:** Development dependencies cover a wide range of tools: `@million/lint`, `@vitejs/plugin-legacy`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `current-device`, `dotenv`, `eslint` and its plugins, `js-cookie`, `lodash`, `sass`, `terser`, `ua-parser-js`, `uuid`, and `vite`.

**Timestamp of Significant Changes:**

The entire state of the `package.json` file, as described above, was recorded at **28/11/2025, 7:51:58**. The internal `date` field within the package itself notes an earlier date of `2025-11-13 21:13:34`, suggesting the last update to the project's internal metadata.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Environment Specificity:** A dominant pattern is the replication of build, packaging, and deployment scripts across three distinct environments: `development`, `preproduction`, and `production`. This indicates a mature deployment pipeline.
*   **Platform Diversity:** The project extensively supports multiple smart TV platforms: `webOS`, `Tizen`, `SmartTV`, and `HbbTV`, with dedicated scripts for each.
*   **Vite as Core Tooling:** `Vite` is consistently used for various stages, including development (`dev`), building (`build`), and previewing (`preview`) the application.
*   **Modular Scripting:** The `scripts` section is highly modular, using `npm run` to chain commands and `node` to execute custom CJS scripts for specific tasks like version checks and app packaging.
*   **Google Cloud Storage Deployment:** For hosted web apps, `gsutil` is the chosen tool for deployment to GCS, with distinct buckets per environment and platform.
*   **Structured Comments:** The `scripts` section is meticulously organized with numbered comments, making it easy to understand the purpose of each group of commands.
