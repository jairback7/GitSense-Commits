## 8:47:43
The `package.json` file for the `3cat_smarttv` project was last modified on 28/11/2025 at 7:51:58. This file outlines a comprehensive script suite for development, building, packaging, and deployment of a SmartTV application.

Key updates and patterns observed include:

*   **Project Metadata:** The project is named "3cat_smarttv", is private, and is currently at version `0.9.4`, build `319`, with an internal project date of `2025-11-13 21:13:34`. It's configured as a `type: "module"`.
*   **Version Management:** Dedicated `upgrade` scripts are present to manage and update the project's version, build number, date, and environment variables using custom Node.js scripts (`check-versions.js`, `check-build-number.js`, `check-date.js`, `update-env-from-package.js`).
*   **Development & Build System:** The project heavily utilizes `vite` for local development, building, and previewing.
    *   **Multiple Modes:** Scripts cater to various development modes: `dev`, `dummy`, `development`, `preproduction`, and `production`.
    *   **Platform-Specific Builds:** Builds are configured for `webOS`, `Tizen`, `SmartTV`, and `HbbTV`, often targeting different output directories (e.g., `dist/smarttv`, `dist/hbbtv`).
    *   **Hosted Webapp Builds:** A specific section exists for building "hosted webapps" for SmartTV and HbbTV across different environments, outputting to `dist/hosted_apps/smarttv_dev`, etc.
*   **Packaging:**
    *   **Launcher Apps:** Scripts are defined to package "launcher apps" for `webOS` and `Tizen` for `DEV`, `PRE`, and `PRO` environments using `package-launcher-apps.cjs`.
    *   **Embedded Apps:** Packaging for "embedded apps" is marked as `TODO` for `webOS` and `Tizen`, indicating future development.
*   **Deployment:** `gsutil` commands are used to deploy the built hosted webapps to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets (e.g., `gs://smartv-dev`, `gs://hbbtv-pre`) with a `Cache-Control` header set to `max-age=5`.
*   **Linting:** `eslint` is configured for code quality checks.
*   **Dependencies:** Core dependencies include `react`, `react-dom`, `react-router-dom`, `whatwg-fetch`, `youboralib` (version `6.7.5`), and `jwt-decode` (version `3.1.2`).
*   **DevDependencies:** Development dependencies include `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `dotenv`, `eslint` and its plugins, `sass`, `terser`, and `vite` (version `5.2.0`).

The `package.json` clearly defines a structured workflow for a complex multi-platform SmartTV application, distinguishing between various environments and deployment strategies.
