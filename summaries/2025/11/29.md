The `package.json` file for the `3cat_smarttv` project, as logged on `28/11/2025, 7:51:58`, defines a comprehensive set of scripts and dependencies for a smart TV application.

**File-Specific Updates & Information:**

*   **Project Metadata:** The project is named `3cat_smarttv`, currently at version `0.9.4`, build `319`, with an internal build date of `2025-11-13 21:13:34`.
*   **Script Organization:** The `scripts` section is extensively categorized with comments, covering distinct phases of the development and deployment lifecycle.
*   **Versioning & Environment Management:** Dedicated scripts (`upgrade_version`, `upgrade_build`, `upgrade_date`, `upgrade_env`) exist to automate updates of project version, build number, date, and environment variables from the `package.json` file itself.
*   **Development & Build System:** `Vite` is heavily used for local development, building applications for various platforms (`webOS`, `Tizen`, `SmartTV`, `HbbTV`), and previewing built assets. Builds consistently target `development`, `preproduction`, and `production` modes, typically outputting to a `dist/` directory (e.g., `dist/smarttv`, `dist/hbbtv`).
*   **Application Packaging:**
    *   Scripts are defined for packaging "launcher apps" for `webOS` and `Tizen` across all three environments (`DEV`, `PRE`, `PRO`), utilizing `package-launcher-apps.cjs`.
    *   Placeholder "TODO" scripts are present for "embedded apps" packaging, indicating future development.
*   **Hosted Webapp Builds & Deployment:**
    *   Separate build processes are outlined for `SmartTV` and `HbbTV` hosted webapps, outputting to `dist/hosted_apps/` subdirectories per environment.
    *   Deployment scripts leverage `gsutil` to copy these built hosted webapps to specific Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets (`gs://smartv-dev`, `gs://hbbtv-prod`, etc.) for each environment, with a `Cache-Control: max-age=5` header set.
*   **Linting:** An `eslint` script is included for code quality checks.
*   **Dependencies:** Key runtime dependencies include `react`, `react-dom`, `react-router-dom`, `whatwg-fetch`, `youboralib` (a video analytics library), and `jwt-decode`.
*   **Development Dependencies:** Development tooling includes `vite` (for bundling), `eslint` and its plugins, `dotenv`, `sass`, `lodash`, and `terser`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Multi-Platform Targeting:** The project consistently builds and packages for different smart TV platforms: `webOS`, `Tizen`, `SmartTV`, and `HbbTV`.
*   **Environment-Specific Workflows:** A strong pattern of `development`, `preproduction` (`pre`), and `production` (`prod`) environments is present across all build, package, and deployment scripts, ensuring distinct configurations and destinations for each stage.
*   **Vite-centric Tooling:** `Vite` serves as the primary build and development tool, indicated by its pervasive use in `dev`, `build`, and `preview` scripts.
*   **Modular Scripting:** Scripts are often broken down by platform and environment, with aggregate "all" scripts to run combined operations (e.g., `package:launcher_app:webos:all`).
*   **Google Cloud Storage for Deployment:** All hosted webapp deployments explicitly use `gsutil` to push assets to GCS, indicating a cloud-based hosting strategy.

*   **DevDependencies**: Development dependencies include `@million/lint` for linting, `@vitejs/plugin-legacy` and `@vitejs/plugin-react` for Vite functionalities, `current-device`, `dotenv`, `eslint` with React-specific plugins, `js-cookie`, `lodash`, `sass`, `terser`, `ua-parser-js`, `uuid`, and `vite` itself.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Vite-centric Workflow**: The project heavily relies on Vite for all aspects of development, building, and previewing.
*   **Multi-Environment Support**: A consistent pattern of `development`, `preproduction`, and `production` environments is applied across builds, packaging, and deployments, ensuring a structured approach to releases.
*   **Platform Specificity**: Scripts are clearly delineated for different SmartTV platforms (webOS, Tizen, SmartTV, HbbTV), highlighting a multi-platform development strategy.
*   **Modular Script Organization**: The use of commented sections (e.g., "// 01 UPGRADE") provides excellent readability and categorizes the extensive list of scripts into logical groups.
*   **Automated Versioning and Deployment**: The `upgrade` scripts and the `deploy` scripts to GCS demonstrate an emphasis on automation for maintaining version consistency and deploying applications.

The file `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\package.json` was last updated on 28/11/2025, 7:51:58.

This `package.json` details the configuration for the "3cat_smarttv" project, indicating version 0.9.4, build 319, and a last internal update date of 2025-11-13 21:13:34. It's configured as a type "module" project.

The `scripts` section is exceptionally comprehensive, categorized into several distinct areas:

*   **Version Management**: Scripts exist to `upgrade_version`, `upgrade_build`, `upgrade_date`, and `upgrade_env` using custom Node.js scripts (`check-versions.js`, `update-env-from-package.js`, etc.), consolidated under a single `upgrade` command.
*   **Development Modes**: Multiple `dev` scripts facilitate local development with `vite`, supporting various modes like `dummy`, `development`, `preproduction`, and `production`, often with `--host` for external access.
*   **Build Processes**: Extensive `build` commands leverage `vite` for different platforms (webOS, Tizen, SmartTV, HBBTV) and environments (development, preproduction, production). These builds output to specific `dist/` subdirectories (e.g., `dist/smarttv`, `dist/hbbtv`, `dist/hosted_apps/`). A `watch:smarttv` command is also available for continuous building.
*   **Preview and Start**: `preview` scripts use `vite preview` to serve built directories for webOS, Tizen, and HBBTV. Corresponding `start` scripts combine previewing with building.
*   **Linting**: An `eslint` command is included for code quality checks.
*   **Device Packaging**:
    *   **Launcher Apps**: Detailed scripts (`package:launcher_app`) are defined for packaging launcher applications for webOS and Tizen across development, preproduction, and production environments using a `package-launcher-apps.cjs` Node.js script. Consolidated `_all` commands simplify running all platform/environment combinations.
    *   **Embedded Apps**: Placeholder scripts (`echo TODO`) indicate future implementation for packaging embedded applications for webOS and Tizen.
*   **Hosted Webapp Builds**: Specific `build:smarttv:hosted_webapp` and `build:hbbtv:hosted_webapp` scripts compile applications for hosted web environments across different stages, outputting to `dist/hosted_apps/`.
*   **Deployment**: Dedicated `deploy` scripts utilize `gsutil` to upload built hosted web applications to Google Cloud Storage buckets (e.g., `gs://smartv-dev`, `gs://hbbtv-prod`). These deployments include a `Cache-Control` header.

**Dependencies** include standard React libraries (`react`, `react-dom`, `react-router-dom`), `whatwg-fetch`, `youboralib` for analytics, and `jwt-decode`.

**Development dependencies** primarily revolve around `vite` and its plugins (`@vitejs/plugin-react`, `@vitejs/plugin-legacy`), `eslint` and its plugins for linting, `sass`, `dotenv`, `lodash`, and `ua-parser-js`, indicating a modern web development setup with a focus on smart TV platforms.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Environment and Platform Specificity**: Almost all build, packaging, and deployment scripts are highly specialized, denoted by suffixes like `:dev`, `:pre`, `:prod` for environments, and `:webos`, `:tizen`, `:smarttv`, `:hbbtv` for platforms.
*   **Vite as Core Tool**: `vite` is central to the project's development, build, and preview workflows.
*   **Structured Output**: A consistent `dist/` directory structure is used to organize built artifacts based on platform, type, and environment.
*   **Automated Deployment**: The inclusion of `gsutil` commands indicates an automated or semi-automated deployment process for hosted web applications to Google Cloud Storage.
*   **Script Chaining**: Many `_all` scripts demonstrate a pattern of chaining multiple `npm run` commands for comprehensive operations.
