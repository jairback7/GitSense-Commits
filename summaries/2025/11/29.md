# Activity Summary for 29/11/2025

## 2:22:29
The `package.json` file for the `3cat_smarttv` project, as logged on `28/11/2025, 7:51:58`, defines a comprehensive set of scripts and dependencies for a smart TV application.

**File-Specific Updates & Information:**

*   **Project Metadata:** The project is named `3cat_smarttv`, currently at version `0.9.4`, build `319`, with an internal build date of `2025-11-13 21:13:34`.
*   **Script Organization:** The `scripts` section is extensively categorized with comments, covering distinct phases of the development and deployment lifecycle.
*   **Versioning & Environment Management:** Dedicated scripts (`upgrade_version`, `upgrade_build`, `upgrade_date`, `upgrade_env`) exist to automate updates of project version, build number, date, and environment variables from the `package.json` file itself.
*   **Development & Build System:** `Vite` is heavily used for local development, building applications for various platforms (`webOS`, `Tizen`, `SmartTV`, `HbbTV`), and previewing built assets. Builds consistently target `development`, `preproduction`, and `production` modes, typically outputting to a `dist/` directory (e.g., `dist/smarttv`, `dist/hbbtv`).
*   **Application Packaging:**
    *   Scripts are defined for packaging "launcher apps" for `webOS` and `Tizen` across all three environments (`DEV`, `PRE`, `PRO`), utilizing `package-launcher-apps.cjs`.
    *   Placeholder "TODO" scripts are present for "embedded apps" packaging, indicating future development.
*   **Hosted Webapp Builds & Deployment:**
    *   Separate build processes are outlined for `SmartTV` and `HbbTV` hosted webapps, outputting to `dist/hosted_apps/` subdirectories per environment.
    *   Deployment scripts leverage `gsutil` to copy these built hosted webapps to specific Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets (`gs://smartv-dev`, `gs://hbbtv-prod`, etc.) for each environment, with a `Cache-Control: max-age=5` header set.
*   **Linting:** An `eslint` script is included for code quality checks.
*   **Dependencies:** Key runtime dependencies include `react`, `react-dom`, `react-router-dom`, `whatwg-fetch`, `youboralib` (a video analytics library), and `jwt-decode`.
*   **Development Dependencies:** Development tooling includes `vite` (for bundling), `eslint` and its plugins, `dotenv`, `sass`, `lodash`, and `terser`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Multi-Platform Targeting:** The project consistently builds and packages for different smart TV platforms: `webOS`, `Tizen`, `SmartTV`, and `HbbTV`.
*   **Environment-Specific Workflows:** A strong pattern of `development`, `preproduction` (`pre`), and `production` (`prod`) environments is present across all build, package, and deployment scripts, ensuring distinct configurations and destinations for each stage.
*   **Vite-centric Tooling:** `Vite` serves as the primary build and development tool, indicated by its pervasive use in `dev`, `build`, and `preview` scripts.
*   **Modular Scripting:** Scripts are often broken down by platform and environment, with aggregate "all" scripts to run combined operations (e.g., `package:launcher_app:webos:all`).
*   **Google Cloud Storage for Deployment:** All hosted webapp deployments explicitly use `gsutil` to push assets to GCS, indicating a cloud-based hosting strategy.

The `package.json` file located at `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\package.json` was last updated or recorded on **28/11/2025, 7:51:58**.

This `package.json` defines a comprehensive build, development, packaging, and deployment workflow for a "3cat_smarttv" project, indicating a multi-platform Smart TV application development.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **Project Metadata:** The project is named "3cat_smarttv", set to version "0.9.4", build "319", and an internal date of "2025-11-13 21:13:34". It's configured as a private ES module (`"type": "module"`).
*   **Extensive Script Definitions:** The `scripts` section is exceptionally detailed and well-organized into 11 distinct categories using comments:
    *   **Version Management (01 UPGRADE):** Includes scripts to automatically update `version`, `build`, `date`, and `env` using dedicated Node.js helper scripts.
    *   **Local Development (02 LOCAL DEVELOPMENT MODES):** Utilizes `vite` for various local development modes, including dummy, development, preproduction, and production, with options for hosting.
    *   **Build Processes (03-05, 10):** Defines `vite build` commands for different platforms and environments:
        *   Base device builds for `webOS` and `Tizen`.
        *   Specific builds for `SmartTV` and `HbbTV` across `development`, `preproduction`, and `production` environments, with dedicated output directories (e.g., `dist/smarttv`, `dist/hbbtv`).
        *   Builds for "Hosted Webapps" for `SmartTV` and `HbbTV` across all environments, outputting to `dist/hosted_apps`.
    *   **Preview and Linting (06, 07):** Scripts for previewing built applications using `vite preview` and for linting JavaScript/JSX files with `eslint`.
    *   **Device Packaging (08, 09):** Commands for packaging "Launcher Apps" for `webOS` and `Tizen` across multiple environments (`DEV`, `PRE`, `PRO`) using `package-launcher-apps.cjs`. There are also placeholder "TODO" scripts for "Embedded Apps".
    *   **Deployment (11 DEPLOY HOSTED WEBAPPS (GCS)):** Scripts to deploy the built hosted webapps (SmartTV and HbbTV for dev, pre, pro environments) to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets using `gsutil`, with a `Cache-Control` header set to `max-age=5`.
*   **Dependencies:** Key runtime dependencies include `react`, `react-dom`, `react-router-dom`, `whatwg-fetch`, `youboralib` (a video analytics library), and `jwt-decode`.
*   **DevDependencies:** Development dependencies cover a wide range, including `@million/lint` (performance linting), `@vitejs/plugin-legacy`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `current-device`, `dotenv`, `eslint` and its plugins, `js-cookie`, `lodash`, `sass`, `terser`, `ua-parser-js`, `uuid`, and `vite`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Vite-centric Workflow:** The project heavily relies on `Vite` for local development, building for various platforms, and generating different output types (e.g., direct device builds, hosted webapps).
*   **Environment-Specific Configurations:** There's a strong and consistent pattern of defining scripts for `development`, `preproduction` (or `pre`), and `production` (or `pro`) environments across builds, packaging, and deployments.
*   **Platform Specialization:** Scripts are clearly categorized for different target platforms: `webOS`, `Tizen`, `SmartTV`, and `HbbTV`.
*   **Structured Scripting:** The `scripts` section is exceptionally well-structured with numbered comments, making it easy to understand the purpose and flow of different operations within the project lifecycle.
*   **Automated Packaging and Deployment:** The inclusion of `package-launcher-apps.cjs` and `gsutil` commands indicates a focus on automating the build, packaging, and deployment processes to Google Cloud Storage.
*   **Version Control Helpers:** The "UPGRADE" section shows an intent to automate the updating of version, build number, and date within the `package.json` itself, as well as syncing environment variables.
