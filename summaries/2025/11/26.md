# Activity Summary for 26/11/2025

## 12:24:40
The provided logs detail styling updates across two main SCSS files within a "3cat_smarttv" project, primarily focusing on component presentation and user interaction feedback. All files consistently import a shared `colors.scss` file, indicating a centralized approach to managing the application's color palette.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\portraitItem\styles.scss` (26/11/2025, 11:54:36)**
    *   This update defines comprehensive styling for a `.portraitItem`, establishing its dimensions (`width: 212px`, `height: 311px`), layout (`display: inline-block`, `overflow: hidden`, `position: relative`), and spacing (`margin-right: 24px`).
    *   Specific rules are set for image cropping within items having a footer (`.rowItem-image.has-footer .imageCropper img`), forcing `height: 263px` and `object-fit: fill`.
    *   Focus and hover states are defined (`.relatedContentRow:not(.fixed) &.focused`, `&:hover`, `.V-SCROLLABLE:not(.fixed) &.focused`), applying `box-shadow`, `border`, `z-index`, and an `outline` using `$base-color-3cat-red` for visual emphasis.
    *   A `.tag` element is styled with a white background, black text, specific font properties, padding, border-radius, and box-shadow, positioned at the top-right.
    *   Styles for `.future-date` (max-width) and a `.platform-logo` container (positioned at the bottom-left with specific dimensions, background, and flexible content alignment, including styles for `.externalLogo` and `.externalIcon`) are also included.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\exitAppModal\styles.kids.scss` (Multiple timestamps)**
    This file, dedicated to the "kid-mode" exit application modal, underwent several iterative styling adjustments, indicating active development and refinement:
    *   **26/11/2025, 11:55:18**: Initial styling sets the modal window's `background-color` to `$base-color-3cat-kid-vibrant-purple`, `margin: 330px auto`, and `height: 444px`. Button styles are defined with specific dimensions, `border-radius`, `font-size`, and `line-height`. The focused state for buttons includes a `box-shadow`, `border-color`, and `3px solid outline` using `$base-color-3cat-kid-white`.
    *   **26/11/2025, 11:59:45 & 12:03:14**: An empty `.content {}` rule was added within the modal window. The content remained functionally identical across these two entries.
    *   **26/11/2025, 12:05:22**: A temporary refactoring moved `margin: 330px auto` from `.modal-window` to the `.content` class.
    *   **26/11/2025, 12:05:37**: This change reverted the previous refactoring, moving `margin: 330px auto` back to `.modal-window`.
    *   **26/11/2025, 12:07:58**: The `margin` and `height` properties were removed from `.modal-window` and replaced with `padding-top: 120px` and `padding-bottom: 120px`, significantly altering the vertical centering/spacing of the modal content.
    *   **26/11/2025, 12:10:12**: A default `border: 1px solid #ffffff` was added to the `.button` element.
    *   **26/11/2025, 12:12:01**: The `outline` thickness for `.button.focused` was reduced from `3px solid` to `1px solid !important`, likely for a subtler focus effect.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\AppData\Local\Temp\tmp25EF.tmp.scss` (26/11/2025, 12:09:20)**
    This temporary file represents an intermediate state, showcasing a `.kid-mode` modal with a vibrant purple background. The button's focused state includes a `box-shadow` and `border-color` using `$base-color-3cat-kid-white`, with a `1px solid outline`. This entry appears to be a snapshot of work-in-progress, possibly reflecting the changes made to the `exitAppModal` but with some button properties omitted.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Color Variable Usage:** All changes heavily rely on SCSS variables for colors, imported from `colors.scss` (e.g., `$base-color-3cat-red`, `$base-color-3cat-kid-vibrant-purple`, `$base-color-3cat-kid-white`), ensuring consistency across the application.
*   **Focus/Hover States:** A consistent pattern for interactive elements (like `.portraitItem` and `.button`) involves defining `&:hover` and `&.focused` states that modify `box-shadow`, `border-color`, and `outline` for clear visual feedback.
*   **SCSS Nesting:** Styles are highly organized using SCSS nesting, reflecting the component hierarchy and making the CSS more readable and maintainable.
*   **"Kid Mode" Specifics:** Components within `.kid-mode` consistently use distinct colors (e.g., purple, kid-white) and potentially different dimensions or visual effects compared to standard modes, indicating tailored user experiences.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** The `styles.kids.scss` file shows multiple small adjustments over a short period, particularly regarding modal positioning (`margin` vs. `padding`) and button styling, suggesting an iterative design and development process to fine-tune the UI.
