The provided log details several styling updates within a Smart TV application, primarily focusing on different types of item displays and a modal component. All changes occurred on 5/11/2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\portraitItem\styles.scss` (7:53:27)**:
    *   This file defines the styling for a `portraitItem` component.
    *   It sets dimensions (212px width, 311px height), margins, and overflow properties.
    *   Includes specific styling for an image cropper within a `.has-footer` state, adjusting image height and position.
    *   Introduces a prominent white `.tag` positioned at the top-right with uppercase text, and a `.platform-logo` at the bottom-left with a dark background.
    *   Defines focus and hover states with `box-shadow` and `outline` using a `--fixedFocus-focus-color` variable.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\styles.scss` (7:53:47)**:
    *   This file styles a `liveItemHome` component, setting its dimensions (390px width, 220px height) and basic layout.
    *   Features an `.external-content` state that increases height and adjusts info container position.
    *   Includes a `bg-bottom-top-gradient` for visual overlay and a `platform-footer` with a dark background, containing a logo and icon.
    *   Defines styling for a `title` with a specific font size and color.
    *   A global `.ellipsis-two-lines` class is defined for text truncation.
    *   Similar to `portraitItem`, it includes focus and hover states with `box-shadow` and `outline` using the `--fixedFocus-focus-color` variable.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\landscapeItem\styles.scss` (7:54:07)**:
    *   This file defines styles for a `landscapeItem`, largely mirroring the structure and elements of `liveItemHome`.
    *   It also sets dimensions (390px width, 220px height), includes the `bg-bottom-top-gradient`, `platform-footer`, `.external-content` state, and title styling.
    *   Notably, it introduces a `.series-title` alongside the main `.title`, both with text truncation capabilities.
    *   It imports `App.scss` in addition to `colors.scss`.
    *   Focus and hover effects are consistent with other item components.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss` (7:57:55 and 7:59:34)**:
    *   The first entry defines the initial styling for an `externalModalOverlay` and `externalPopup`.
    *   The overlay provides a fixed, semi-transparent dark background, centering the popup.
    *   The `externalPopup` is a flex row with a dark background, rounded corners, and shadow.
    *   It's split into `popupLeft` (for an image and platform logo container) and `popupRight` (for text content and buttons).
    *   `promoTextRow` has a background of `#222`, while `platformLogoContainer` initially has a background of `#333`.
    *   The second entry for this file, just under two minutes later (7:59:34), indicates a minor refinement: the `background` color for the `.platformLogoContainer` within `popupLeft` was updated from `#333` to `#272525`. All other styles remained the same.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focus/Hover States:** A highly consistent pattern across all item components (`portraitItem`, `liveItemHome`, `landscapeItem`) for both `:hover` and `.focused` states. These invariably apply `box-shadow`, `border-color`, and `outline` properties, using the `var(--fixedFocus-focus-color)` CSS variable and `!important` declarations to ensure override.
*   **Imports:** All SCSS files for item components begin with `@import "../../../../colors.scss";` (and `landscapeItem` adds `App.scss`).
*   **Platform Information:** `portraitItem` includes a `.platform-logo`, while `liveItemHome` and `landscapeItem` feature a more elaborate `.platform-footer` block, both serving to display platform-related branding or icons at the bottom of the item.
*   **Text Truncation:** The `.ellipsis-two-lines` class (and similar inline applications) is frequently used on titles and series titles within `liveItemHome` and `landscapeItem` to manage text overflow.
*   **Gradient Overlays:** `liveItemHome` and `landscapeItem` both utilize a `bg-bottom-top-gradient` to create a visual fade at the bottom of the item.
*   **External Content Styling:** `liveItemHome` and `landscapeItem` share a common `.external-content` modifier to adjust their height and internal layout when displaying content from external sources.
*   **Timestamps:** The changes show a rapid succession of styling definitions for the main item components between 7:53 and 7:54, followed by a concentrated effort on the modal component between 7:57 and 7:59.
