# Activity Summary for 14/1/2026

## 9:07:44
The `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss` file, last updated on `14/1/2026, 8:58:36`, defines the typography for the application.

**File-specific updates:**
The file primarily sets up two custom font families: "Bw 3Cat" and "Roboto".
*   **"Bw 3Cat"**: This font is extensively defined with multiple weights (Thin, Light, Regular, Dotted, Rounded, Medium, Bold, Heavy, Black) using both `.ttf` and `.woff` formats, sourced from `fonts/bw3cat_ttf/` and `fonts/bw3cat/` directories respectively.
*   **"Roboto"**: This font is also defined with various weights (Thin, Light, Regular, Medium, Bold, Black) using `.ttf` format, sourced from the `fonts/Roboto/` directory.
*   The `body` element is explicitly set to use `"Bw 3Cat"` as its primary font, with `sans-serif` as a fallback.

**Patterns and recurring elements:**
*   **Comprehensive Font Definitions**: Both font families include a wide spectrum of `font-weight` values, ranging from 100 (Thin) to 900 (Black), indicating support for a diverse typographic hierarchy.
*   **Multi-format Font Loading**: For "Bw 3Cat", both `.ttf` and `.woff` formats are specified for many weights, which is a common practice to ensure broad browser compatibility. "Roboto" primarily uses `.ttf`.
*   **Consistent `@font-face` Structure**: Each font variant is defined using the standard `@font-face` rule, specifying `font-family`, `src` with `url()` and `format()`, `font-weight`, and `font-style`.
*   **Organized Font Paths**: Font files are organized in a structured manner within a `fonts/` directory, differentiating between `bw3cat_ttf`, `bw3cat`, and `Roboto` subfolders.

The project primarily focuses on setting up a Smart TV application, specifically handling initial load, font definitions, and network connectivity checks.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss` (14/1/2026, 8:58:36)**: This file defines a comprehensive set of `@font-face` rules for two font families: "Bw 3Cat" and "Roboto". "Bw 3Cat" is defined with multiple weights (Thin, Light, Regular, Medium, Bold, Heavy, Black, Dotted, Rounded) in both `.ttf` and `.woff` formats, while "Roboto" includes Black, Bold, Light, Medium, Regular, and Thin `.ttf` variations. The `body` element is set to use "Bw 3Cat" as its primary font.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\3cat_pro\gateway\js\app.js` (Multiple timestamps)**: This JavaScript file contains the core logic for the application's initial setup and network handling.
    *   **14/1/2026, 9:08:12**: An `init` function was established. It checks the webOS SDK version (`sdkVersion`) to determine which connection manager service to use (`luna://com.palm.connectionmanager` for older versions, `luna://com.webos.service.connectionmanager` for newer). It then requests the internet connection status. If connected, the application redirects to `https://smartv-pro.3cat.website/index.html`. If not connected, it displays a "no connection" alert (`.alert-info-view`), registers a `VK_BACK` key handler, and subscribes to network status changes to automatically redirect once a connection is re-established.
    *   **14/1/2026, 9:13:02**: A temporary modification was introduced. When an internet connection was available, instead of redirecting, the application was changed to display the "no connection" alert (`$('.alert-info-view').removeClass('no-visible');`). This appears to be for testing the alert UI.
    *   **14/1/2026, 9:48:07** and **14/1/2026, 9:49:38**: The previous temporary change was reverted. The `app.js` file was restored to its original functionality, where a successful internet connection correctly triggers a redirection to the remote URL.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\3cat_pro\gateway\css\gateway.css` (14/1/2026, 9:11:26)**: This CSS file defines the styling for the gateway and the "no connection" alert. It includes a specific `@font-face` rule for "Bw 3Cat Light" (`../font/bw3cat_ttf/Bw3Cat-Light.ttf`). It provides styles for `.alert-info-view`, `.container`, `.logo`, `.title`, `.subtitle`, and `.text`, and implements responsive design using `@media` queries for `1920px` and `1280px` widths, adjusting dimensions, font sizes, and logo image paths accordingly.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\3cat_pro\index.html` (14/1/2026, 9:12:01)**: This is the main HTML entry point for the application. It sets up basic meta tags, links to `gateway.css`, and includes necessary JavaScript files: `jquery.js`, `webOSTV.js`, and `app.js`. The `body` tag includes an `onload="init();"` call to start the application logic. The HTML body also contains the structure for the `.alert-info-view` to display the "Sense connexió" (No connection) message.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **14/1/2026, 8:58:36**: Comprehensive font definitions were established in `fonts.scss`.
*   **14/1/2026, 9:08:12**: The core webOS TV application logic for network detection and redirection was initially implemented in `app.js`.
*   **14/1/2026, 9:11:26**: Styling and responsive design for the "no connection" alert UI were added in `gateway.css`.
*   **14/1/2026, 9:12:01**: The main `index.html` file was set up, integrating all necessary components.
*   **14/1/2026, 9:13:02**: A notable, albeit temporary, modification in `app.js` changed connection success behavior to display the alert instead of redirecting.
*   **14/1/2026, 9:48:07**: This modification was reverted in `app.js`, restoring the intended redirection logic upon successful connection.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Custom Font Integration:** Both `fonts.scss` and `gateway.css` consistently define and utilize the "Bw 3Cat" font family, indicating a custom brand typeface being integrated across the UI.
*   **webOS TV Platform Focus:** The JavaScript code (`app.js`) heavily relies on webOS TV services and APIs (e.g., `luna://com.webos.service.connectionmanager`, `webOS.service.request`, `webOS.platformBack()`), confirming the target platform.
*   **Network Connectivity as a Core Concern:** A significant portion of the `app.js` logic is dedicated to detecting internet connectivity, handling its absence by displaying an alert, and subscribing to changes for automatic recovery.
*   **Gateway/Initial Load State:** The "no connection" alert (`.alert-info-view`) is a central component for the initial user experience, ensuring users are informed if they cannot access the main application content.
*   **Remote Application URL:** The URL `https://smartv-pro.3cat.website/index.html` is a recurring destination for redirection when a network connection is available.
*   **Error Handling:** Basic error logging for network status (`console.error('Error en la obtención del estado de red');`) is consistently present in `app.js`.
*   **Responsive Design Implementation:** The `gateway.css` file demonstrates a pattern of using `@media` queries to adapt the layout and visual elements for different screen resolutions, which is typical for TV applications.
