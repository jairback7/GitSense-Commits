# Activity Summary for 14/1/2026

The `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss` file, last updated on `14/1/2026, 8:58:36`, defines the typography for the application.

**File-specific updates:**
The file primarily sets up two custom font families: "Bw 3Cat" and "Roboto".
*   **"Bw 3Cat"**: This font is extensively defined with multiple weights (Thin, Light, Regular, Dotted, Rounded, Medium, Bold, Heavy, Black) using both `.ttf` and `.woff` formats, sourced from `fonts/bw3cat_ttf/` and `fonts/bw3cat/` directories respectively.
*   **"Roboto"**: This font is also defined with various weights (Thin, Light, Regular, Medium, Bold, Black) using `.ttf` format, sourced from the `fonts/Roboto/` directory.
*   The `body` element is explicitly set to use `"Bw 3Cat"` as its primary font, with `sans-serif` as a fallback.

**Patterns and recurring elements:**
*   **Comprehensive Font Definitions**: Both font families include a wide spectrum of `font-weight` values, ranging from 100 (Thin) to 900 (Black), indicating support for a diverse typographic hierarchy.
*   **Multi-format Font Loading**: For "Bw 3Cat", both `.ttf` and `.woff` formats are specified for many weights, which is a common practice to ensure broad browser compatibility. "Roboto" primarily uses `.ttf`.
*   **Consistent `@font-face` Structure**: Each font variant is defined using the standard `@font-face` rule, specifying `font-family`, `src` with `url()` and `format()`, `font-weight`, and `font-style`.
*   **Organized Font Paths**: Font files are organized in a structured manner within a `fonts/` directory, differentiating between `bw3cat_ttf`, `bw3cat`, and `Roboto` subfolders.
