# Activity Summary for 24/1/2026

## 9:59:56
The provided log details changes primarily focused on the **3CAT Smart TV App's build processes, platform utilities, image handling, and analytics integration**, with most significant activity occurring between **January 17, 2026, and January 23, 2026**.

**Key Information and File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`build_templates/README.md` (17/1/2026, 10:37:02 and 11:11:00):** This file received initial definition and then an update. It outlines the structure and purpose of the `build_templates` directory, which houses base project templates for 3CAT Smart TV Apps across Tizen and WebOS platforms (DEV, PRE, PRO environments). It details two app types: `launcher_app` (minimal shell loading a hosted web version) and `embedded_app` (future fully embedded version). The update at 11:11:00 modified the `webos` folder structure from `webos/App3Cat_DEV/` to `webos/3cat_dev/` etc., standardizing the naming convention to `3cat_[ENV]`.

*   **`build_templates/tizen/README.md` (17/1/2026, 10:37:46):** This file provides basic Tizen CLI commands for packaging (`tizen package`), listing devices (`sdb devices`), and installing (`tizen install`) `.wgt` packages.

*   **Tizen Gateway JavaScript Files (`build_templates/tizen/3cat_dev/gateway/js/app.js` at 10:45:06 and `build_templates/tizen/3cat_pre/gateway/js/app.js` at 10:45:19):** These JavaScript files define the `init()` function for Tizen apps. They are responsible for checking network connectivity and then redirecting to either a development (`https://smartv-dev.3cat.website/index.html`) or pre-production (`https://smartv-pre.3cat.website/index.html`) hosted web application. They also register key handlers for 'Back' and 'Exit' to close the application. The content is nearly identical, differing only in the `REMOTE` URL.

*   **Tizen Configuration XML Files (`build_templates/tizen/3cat_dev/config.xml` at 11:02:30 and `build_templates/tizen/3cat_pre/config.xml` at 11:03:00):** These XML files define the Tizen application's configuration, including `widget` ID and version (initially `3.4.6`), `access` origins, `application` ID, content source, features, icons, metadata (e.g., `prelaunch.support`, `use.network`, `devel.api.version`, `use.preview`), application name ("3Cat"), and a comprehensive list of `privilege` declarations (e.g., `application.launch`, `system`, `tv.inputdevice`, `internet`). Both files share almost identical content, except for the `tizen:application`'s `id` and `package` attributes.

*   **Tizen and WebOS Project Files (`build_templates/tizen/3cat_dev/.project`, `build_templates/tizen/3cat_pre/.project`, `build_templates/webos/3cat_dev/.project`, `build_templates/webos/3cat_pre/.project` between 11:16:08 and 11:34:16):** These `.project` XML files define project metadata, build commands (like `json.validation.builder`, `org.tizen.web.project.builder.WebBuilder`, `com.webos.ide.nature.WebOSBuilder`), and natures (e.g., `jsNature`, `WebNature`, `WebOSProjectNature`). Changes include renaming projects (e.g., `3catdev` to `3catDev`, `3cat_pre` to `3catPre` and back to `3cat_pre`) and correcting/standardizing project names (e.g., `3cat_dev` for Tizen and WebOS environments).

*   **WebOS Gateway JavaScript Files (`build_templates/webos/3cat_dev/gateway/js/app.js` at 11:21:52 and `build_templates/webos/3cat_pre/gateway/js/app.js` at 11:36:57 and 11:43:23):** These `app.js` files for WebOS manage network connection status and redirect to either a development (`https://smartv-dev.3cat.website/index.html`) or pre-production (`https://smartv-pre.3cat.website/index.html`) hosted web app. They use WebOS-specific `luna` services (`com.webos.service.connectionmanager`, `com.palm.connectionmanager`) and handle device SDK versioning. The 11:43:23 update to the pre-production file specifically adds a `?pr=true` query parameter to the `REMOTE` URL, potentially for preview or pre-production tracking.

*   **WebOS App Info JSON Files (`build_templates/webos/3cat_pre/appinfo.json` at 11:34:24 and 11:35:20; `build_templates/webos/3cat_dev/appinfo.json` at 11:34:33 and 11:35:29):** These JSON files define WebOS application metadata such as `appDescription`, `icon`, `main` HTML, `title`, `type` (web), `resolution`, `version`, `splashBackground`, `vendor`, `largeIcon`, `iconColor`, `id`, `uiRevision`, and `disableBackHistoryAPI`. A notable change across both DEV and PRE environments around 11:35:20/29 involves updating the `id` from `cat.3cat.webos` to `com.mediapro.3cat`.

*   **`package-launcher-apps.cjs` (17/1/2026, 10:56:17 to 22/1/2026, 18:02:56):** This Node.js script is crucial for the automated packaging of launcher applications. It handles CLI argument parsing for `platform` and `env`, reads application name from `package.json`, prompts for binary version, and manages directories. It contains platform-specific logic for WebOS (multi-resolution packaging using `ares-package` and `appinfo.json` updates) and Tizen (packaging `.wgt` files using `tizen package` and `config.xml` updates). Changes indicate continuous refinement, including minor formatting and logging adjustments.

*   **`src/utils/platformUtils.js` (17/1/2026, 12:23:41 to 20/1/2026, 11:56:50):** This file centralizes platform-specific utilities. It initializes `window.AppGlobal` for shared application state (actions, platform, version, etc.) and `window.PlatformUtils` for user agent, platform detection (`getPlatform`), and resolution configuration (`configurePlatformResolution`). The `getPlatform` function detects platforms like HbbTV, Tizen, WebOS (with a fix for "Web0S" and "WebOS" in user agent strings), Hisense, and LG NetCast, and dynamically injects `webOSTV.js` for WebOS. Later changes streamline platform detection by removing "hisense" as a specific platform and fetching `platformOverride` from URL query parameters. Minor console logging adjustments were also made.

*   **`src/App.jsx` (17/1/2026, 12:27:06 to 12:43:32):** This React root component handles application routing, state management (using various Context Providers), and platform initialization. It sets up debug consoles, constructs build information from environment variables, and manages exit/logout modals. A notable change at 12:27:35 and 12:43:32 involved modifying the `InitApp` function to remove the `platformOverride` parameter, suggesting `Platform.getPlatform()` now handles query string overrides internally.

*   **`src/platform/platform.js` (17/1/2026, 12:37:07):** This file acts as a platform abstraction layer, importing and calling platform-specific initialization functions (TizenDevice, WebosDevice, HbbTVDevice, BrowserDevice) based on `window.AppGlobal.platform`. It also initializes keyboard navigation tailored to HbbTV or generic SmartTVs and includes a `launchApp` function for platform-specific app launching.

*   **`src/platform/generic.js` (17/1/2026, 12:57:09 to 12:59:31):** This file defines generic keyboard navigation for SmartTVs. It includes `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartTV` which handles keydown events for navigation (up, down, left, right), action (Enter), and back/exit keys (e.g., keyCode 8, 10009 for Tizen, 461 for WebOS, 88 for Hisense, 0x1cd for TIVO). A specific update at 12:59:31 replaced `0x1cd` with `461` for TIVO and added `166` (VK_ESCAPE) and `27` (VK_BACK_SPACE) to the back key handling.

*   **`package.json` (20/1/2026, 11:00:55):** This file defines the project's metadata (name, version, build, date) and an extensive set of `scripts` for versioning (`upgrade_version`, `upgrade_build`, `upgrade_date`, `upgrade_env`), local development (`dev`, `dev-local:*`), base device builds (`build:webos`, `build:tizen`), SmartTV and HbbTV builds with specific output directories and modes, preview commands, linting, and a comprehensive set of device packaging scripts for `launcher_apps` (WebOS and Tizen, for DEV, PRE, PRO, and all environments) and placeholders for future `embedded_apps`. It also lists project `dependencies` and `devDependencies`.

*   **`src/libs/img.js` (21/1/2026, 12:24:48 to 15:40:18):** This file manages image processing, specifically generating image URLs using an `IMGPROXY_URL` and selecting the "best" image from a list based on width, height, aspect ratio, and priority formats. It defines `IMGPROXY_PRESETS` for different image widths. Significant changes include:
    *   Initial comments for `getImgProxyUrl` were uncommented, activating the image proxy logic.
    *   `getBestImage` was updated to accept an array of `forceFormat` values and to include `is_external` in the returned `bestImage` object.
    *   `getImgProxyUrl` logic was refined to only use the `IMGPROXY_URL` for "safe" URLs (same origin and no query parameters) and to return the original `imgUrl` otherwise.
    *   Conditional application of `getImgProxyUrl` in `getBestImage` and `getBestImageV2` based on `!bestImage.is_external`, indicating that external images should not be processed by the internal image proxy.

*   **`src/components/items/rowItems/portraitItem/index.jsx` (21/1/2026, 12:44:34):** This React component renders a portrait-oriented item in a row. It uses `generateImageData` to get image data and `ImageCropper` to display it. An update ensures that the `imgData.frameSize.h` is adjusted for external content with a platform logo to account for a footer.

*   **`src/components/modals/externalContentModal/index.jsx` (21/1/2026, 12:46:58 to 13:17:26):** This React component defines a modal for displaying external content information. It uses `generateImageData` to fetch images for the modal, displays promotional and platform-specific text, and provides buttons to open external content or continue to the 3CAT app. Multiple updates focused on ensuring that a placeholder `no-image` div is rendered when `imgData.image` is null or its `file` property is missing, improving robustness in image display. It also explicitly imports `ImageCropper` in the final version.

*   **`src/components/modals/externalContentModal/styles.scss` (21/1/2026, 13:36:16 to 13:52:29):** This SCSS file styles the `ExternalContentModal`. Changes primarily adjust the positioning of the `.platformLogoContainer` within `.popupLeft`, initially using `position: absolute; bottom: 0;` and later changing it to `position: relative; top: 544px;`.

*   **`src/components/imageCropper/index.jsx` (21/1/2026, 14:06:50 to 14:27:28):** This React component handles image cropping and display. It takes `frameSize` and `imageSize` to adjust how an image is displayed within a given frame, with options for horizontal and vertical centering. Updates refined the handling of `imageAspectRatio` to prevent division by zero and introduced a "protection" check for minimum required image data (`imageSource`, `frameSize.w/h`, `imageSize.w/h`) to ensure graceful rendering of a `no-image` placeholder if data is incomplete. The calculation for `imageAspectRatio` was briefly simplified to `1` then restored.

*   **`src/contexts/settingsContext.jsx` (21/1/2026, 15:47:39):** This React context manages application settings, including fetching them via `ApiGetSettings`. It sets global variables like `window.currentGeozone`, `window.AppProfile`, and `window.appConfig.IMGPROXY_URL`, and also updates the `staticPagesJson` in the `SitecatalystContext`.

*   **`src/contexts/sitecatalystContext.jsx` (23/1/2026, 12:17:56 and 12:18:43 and 13:35:06):** This React context handles Adobe Sitecatalyst (Omniture) analytics. It defines common variables, sets the analytics account (`OMACCOUNT` or `DEVACCOUNT`), tracks visitor IDs, device IDs, login states, and manages page/video tracking. Updates included refining the `s.eVar23` and `s.prop23` values to explicitly differentiate between 'HbbTV' and 'SmartTV' platforms and adding `s.eVar10` and `s.prop10` for `window.AppGlobal.platform`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Platform-Specific Logic:** A strong recurring pattern is the distinction between `tizen`, `webos`, `hbbtv`, `lg`, and `browser` platforms. This is evident in:
    *   Build templates and configurations (`build_templates` directory, `config.xml`, `appinfo.json`).
    *   Gateway `app.js` files with different URLs and API calls.
    *   The `package-launcher-apps.cjs` script which has distinct packaging commands and logic for WebOS (multi-resolution `.ipk` files) and Tizen (`.wgt` files).
    *   `platformUtils.js` which detects the current platform and dynamically injects platform-specific libraries (e.g., `webOSTV.js`).
    *   `platform.js` acting as a dispatcher for platform-specific device initialization.
    *   `generic.js` handling keyboard input with different key codes for various Smart TV platforms.
    *   `sitecatalystContext.jsx` explicitly logging platform as "HbbTV" or "SmartTV".
*   **Environment-Specific Configuration:** The application consistently distinguishes between `DEV`, `PRE`, and `PRO` environments for URLs, application IDs, and potentially other settings. This is clearly seen in the `build_templates` structure and the `package-launcher-apps.cjs` script.
*   **Image Handling and Optimization:** There's a concentrated effort around managing images, particularly through:
    *   Using an `IMGPROXY_URL` for image transformation and optimization.
    *   Defining `IMGPROXY_PRESETS` for various image widths.
    *   Functions like `getBestImage` and `getBestImageV2` for selecting the most appropriate image based on desired dimensions, aspect ratio, and content (e.g., `has_text`).
    *   Filtering out `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` for images.
    *   Handling external images differently, preventing them from being processed by the internal image proxy.
    *   The `ImageCropper` component for rendering images effectively within a UI.
*   **Application Initialization and Global State:** The `window.AppGlobal` object serves as a central repository for application-wide state and actions, configured early in the `platformUtils.js` and `App.jsx` files.
*   **Analytics Integration:** The `sitecatalystContext.jsx` shows a consistent approach to integrating Adobe Sitecatalyst (Omniture) for tracking, including common variables, page views, and video events.
*   **Modals and User Interaction:** Components like `ExternalContentModal` and `ExitAppModal` indicate a focus on structured user interaction and flow within the TV application.
*   **Focus Management:** Explicit `nav.focusById()` calls and `data-nav-strategy` attributes in React components indicate a custom or external navigation/focus management system tailored for TV remote control interactions.
*   **Timestamp Consistency:** Most changes are batched into distinct periods (e.g., 17/1/2026, 21/1/2026, 23/1/2026), suggesting focused development sessions on specific features or areas.

**Files Excluded from Summary:**

*   `c:\tizen-studio-data\profile\profiles.xml`: This file was correctly excluded as it contains security profile information, likely including paths to private keys (`author.p12`, `distributor.p12`) and their password files (`.pwd`), which are sensitive.

## 15:01:55
The provided log details changes related to the development and packaging of 3CAT Smart TV applications for various platforms (Tizen, WebOS, HbbTV). The changes span from January 17, 2026, to January 23, 2026.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\README.md`** (Initial: 17/1/2026, 10:37:02, Update: 17/1/2026, 11:11:00):
    *   **Initial state**: Describes the purpose of build templates for 3CAT Smart TV Apps across `tizen` and `webos` platforms, differentiating between `launcher_app` and `embedded_app` types. It outlines the folder structure, with `webos` having `App3Cat_DEV`, `App3Cat_PRE`, `App3Cat_PRO`.
    *   **Update**: The folder structure for `webos` within the `README.md` was changed from `App3Cat_DEV/App3Cat_PRE/App3Cat_PRO/` to `3cat_dev/3cat_pre/3cat_pro/`, standardizing the naming convention to match `tizen`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\tizen\README.md`** (17/1/2026, 10:37:46):
    *   Provides basic Tizen CLI commands for packaging (`tizen package`), listing devices (`sdb devices`), and installing packages (`tizen install`).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\tizen\3cat_dev\gateway\js\app.js`** (17/1/2026, 10:45:06):
    *   Contains an `init` function that attempts to load a remote hosted web app (`https://smartv-dev.3cat.website/index.html`) for the `DEV` environment on Tizen. It includes network connectivity checks and handles back/exit key presses to close the application if there's no network.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\tizen\3cat_pre\gateway\js\app.js`** (17/1/2026, 10:45:19):
    *   Similar to the `dev` version, but targets the `PRE` environment with `https://smartv-pre.3cat.website/index.html`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\package-launcher-apps.cjs`** (Multiple updates: 17/1/2026, 10:56:17 to 22/1/2026, 18:02:56):
    *   This Node.js script is responsible for packaging launcher applications for WebOS and Tizen.
    *   It parses CLI arguments for `platform` and `env`, prompts for a binary version, reads the app name from `package.json`, and manages temporary directories.
    *   For WebOS, it handles multi-resolution packages (720p, 1080p), updates `appinfo.json` with resolution and version, and uses `ares-package`.
    *   For Tizen, it updates `config.xml` with the binary version and uses `tizen package`, including an option to prompt the user for a security profile to sign PRO packages.
    *   **Minor changes across timestamps** mostly appear to be formatting adjustments (e.g., changing string literals from double quotes to single quotes) and adding missing `stdio: 'inherit'` to `execSync` calls for Tizen, then reverting some formatting. The core logic remained consistent.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\tizen\3cat_dev\config.xml`** (17/1/2026, 11:02:30) and **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\tizen\3cat_pre\config.xml`** (17/1/2026, 11:03:00):
    *   These XML configuration files for Tizen apps specify application metadata, privileges, and settings (e.g., `version="3.4.6"`, `screen-orientation="landscape"`). They define the entry point as `index.html` and include metadata for Samsung TV platforms. The `id` and `package` attributes are unique for DEV (`i40jdPIQJb.3Cat`) and PRE (`PMVOmA9N8K.3Cat`) environments.

*   **`.project` files within `build_templates` (Tizen and WebOS subdirectories)** (Multiple updates from 17/1/2026, 11:16:08 to 17/1/2026, 11:34:16):
    *   These XML files describe project configurations for IDEs like Tizen Studio and WebOS IDE.
    *   Changes mostly involve renaming the `<name>` tag (e.g., `3catdev` to `3cat_dev`, `3cat_pre` to `3catPre` then back to `3cat_pre`).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\webos\3cat_dev\gateway\js\app.js`** (17/1/2026, 11:21:52):
    *   Similar to Tizen's `app.js`, this handles WebOS-specific network checks and navigation for the `DEV` environment, redirecting to `https://smartv-dev.3cat.website/index.html`. It detects SDK version to determine connection manager service (`luna://com.webos.service.connectionmanager` or `luna://com.palm.connectionmanager`) and handles back button events.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\webos\3cat_pre\appinfo.json`** (Initial: 17/1/2026, 11:34:24, Update: 17/1/2026, 11:35:20) and **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\webos\3cat_dev\appinfo.json`** (Initial: 17/1/2026, 11:34:33, Update: 17/1/2026, 11:35:29):
    *   These `appinfo.json` files for WebOS applications define app metadata like `title`, `version`, `resolution`, `vendor`, and `id`.
    *   **Update**: The `id` field was changed from `cat.3cat.webos` to `com.mediapro.3cat`, unifying the application identifier.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\webos\3cat_pre\gateway\js\app.js`** (Initial: 17/1/2026, 11:36:57, Update: 17/1/2026, 11:43:23):
    *   Similar to the `dev` version, but for `PRE` environment, pointing to `https://smartv-pre.3cat.website/index.html`.
    *   **Update**: A query parameter `?pr=true` was added to the `REMOTE` URL for the `PRE` environment, likely indicating a pre-release or preview flag.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\utils\platformUtils.js`** (Multiple updates from 17/1/2026, 12:23:41 to 20/1/2026, 11:56:50):
    *   This utility manages platform detection, global application variables (`AppGlobal`), and resolution configuration.
    *   **Key changes**:
        *   Removed "hisense" from the list of platform strings `window.PlatformUtils.getPlatform` handles (17/1/2026, 12:31:32).
        *   Modified `window.PlatformUtils.getPlatform` to prioritize a platform specified via a URL query parameter (`platformOverride`) before detecting it from the User Agent (17/1/2026, 12:32:29). This override logic was initially passed as an argument and then moved to be read directly from URL params.
        *   Added a `return "browser"` statement accidentally (20/1/2026, 11:07:44) which would prevent other platform detections, and then fixed it by removing it again (20/1/2026, 11:23:38).
        *   Added `console.log(window.KeyEvent)` for debugging (20/1/2026, 11:30:28), which was then removed.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx`** (Multiple updates from 17/1/2026, 12:27:06 to 17/1/2026, 12:43:32):
    *   The main React application component.
    *   **Key changes**:
        *   Modified the `InitApp` function to remove the `platformOverride` parameter, as platform detection logic moved into `Platform.getPlatform` (17/1/2026, 12:27:35 and 17/1/2026, 12:43:32). This makes `Platform.getPlatform()` directly handle query string overrides internally.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\platform.js`** (17/1/2026, 12:37:07):
    *   This file centralizes platform-specific initialization and app launching.
    *   It imports device-specific modules (TizenDevice, WebosDevice, HbbTVDevice, BrowserDevice) and keyboard navigation functions.
    *   The `launchApp` function uses the global `AppGlobal.platform` to determine which platform's `launchApp` function to call.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js`** (Initial: 17/1/2026, 12:57:09, Update: 17/1/2026, 12:59:31):
    *   Handles generic keyboard navigation for Smart TVs.
    *   **Update**: Modified keycodes for "Back" functionality, specifically changing `0x1cd` (TIVO) to `461` (LG WebOS TV) and adding `27` (VK\_ESCAPE) as a backspace keycode (17/1/2026, 12:59:31). This indicates a refinement in key handling for various Smart TV remotes.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\package.json`** (20/1/2026, 11:00:55):
    *   Updated `version` to "1.0.4", `build` to "328", and `date` to "2026-01-16 08:40:40".
    *   Added extensive npm scripts for various build, preview, and packaging tasks for WebOS, Tizen, SmartTV, and HbbTV, including hosted web app builds and deployment commands for Google Cloud Storage (GCS). This significantly expands the automated build and deployment capabilities.

*   **`c:\tizen-studio-data\profile\profiles.xml`** (Initial: 21/1/2026, 11:41:12, Update: 21/1/2026, 11:41:44):
    *   **Initial state**: Defines Tizen security profiles "SHTV\_PARTNER" and "SHTV\_PUBLIC", each with paths to author and distributor certificates. It contained a duplicate "SHTV\_PUBLIC" profile with paths pointing to a "CCMA" folder.
    *   **Update**: Corrected the duplicate "SHTV\_PUBLIC" profile by renaming it to "CCMA", ensuring distinct security profiles.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\libs\img.js`** (Multiple updates from 21/1/2026, 12:24:48 to 21/1/2026, 15:40:18):
    *   This utility manages image proxy URLs and the selection of the best image based on dimensions, aspect ratio, and format.
    *   **Key changes**:
        *   Initially, `getImgProxyUrl` conditionally returned `options.imgUrl` or `null` if `IMGPROXY_URL` was not set, effectively disabling proxy.
        *   Modified `getImgProxyUrl` to generate proxy URLs only for images originating from the same host and without query parameters, otherwise returning the original `imgUrl`. This was then reverted back to the previous logic of only using the proxy if `window.appConfig.IMGPROXY_URL` is set, and returning `null` otherwise (21/1/2026, 14:35:29). This implies a decision to strictly use the proxy or not at all, rather than a fallback to direct URL.
        *   Added `is_external` property to the `bestImage` object returned by `getBestImage` to track if an image is from an external source (21/1/2026, 15:26:59).
        *   Modified `getBestImage` and `getBestImageV2` to *not* apply the image proxy if `bestImage.is_external` is true, ensuring external image URLs are used directly (21/1/2026, 15:27:33, 21/1/2026, 15:29:21, 21/1/2026, 15:30:10, 21/1/2026, 15:36:09, 21/1/2026, 15:36:29, 21/1/2026, 15:37:10, 21/1/2026, 15:39:37, 21/1/2026, 15:40:18). This is a crucial change for handling external content.
        *   `getBestImage`'s `forceFormat` parameter was updated to accept an array of formats (21/1/2026, 12:43:50).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\portraitItem\index.jsx`** (21/1/2026, 12:44:34) and **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\index.jsx`** (Multiple updates from 21/1/2026, 12:46:58 to 21/1/2026, 13:17:26):
    *   These React components are related to displaying content items and a modal for external content.
    *   **`portraitItem`**: Accounts for external content by adjusting `imgData.frameSize.h` if `isExternal` and `platformLogo` are present, making space for a footer.
    *   **`externalContentModal`**:
        *   Changed `generateImageData` call to include `['modal-portrait', 'portrait']` for `forceFormat`, indicating a preference for specific image formats within the modal (21/1/2026, 12:47:08).
        *   Introduced conditional rendering for the image, showing a "no-image" div if `imgData.image?.file` is null or undefined (21/1/2026, 12:57:22). This was then refined to explicitly check for `imgData?.image === null` or `!imgData?.image` (21/1/2026, 13:09:03, 21/1/2026, 13:16:48, 21/1/2026, 13:17:10, 21/1/2026, 13:17:26).
        *   Re-added `ImageCropper` component for displaying the image within the modal, which was previously commented out (21/1/2026, 13:17:10).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss`** (Multiple updates from 21/1/2026, 13:36:16 to 21/1/2026, 13:52:29):
    *   Styling for the external content modal.
    *   **Key changes**:
        *   Removed `img` styles from `.popupLeft` to allow `ImageCropper` to manage image sizing (21/1/2026, 13:38:27).
        *   Adjusted the positioning of `.platformLogoContainer` from `position: absolute; bottom: 0;` to `position: relative; top: 544px;`, which seems like an attempt to correctly place the logo at the bottom of the image area (21/1/2026, 13:52:29). This is likely related to the image cropping changes.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\imageCropper\index.jsx`** (Multiple updates from 21/1/2026, 14:06:50 to 21/1/2026, 14:27:28):
    *   This component crops images based on frame and image sizes.
    *   **Key changes**:
        *   Introduced a check `imageSize.h ? imageSize.w / imageSize.h : 1` for `imageAspectRatio` to prevent division by zero (21/1/2026, 14:09:02, 21/1/2026, 14:09:50). This was then removed, assuming `imageSize.h` will always be valid, and then reintroduced.
        *   Added a "protection" block to return a "no-image" div early if critical `imageSource`, `frameSize`, or `imageSize` properties are missing or zero (21/1/2026, 14:26:15). This protection was subsequently removed (21/1/2026, 14:27:28).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\contexts\settingsContext.jsx`** (21/1/2026, 15:47:39):
    *   Loads application settings, including `IMGPROXY_URL`, `geo_value`, and `profile`.
    *   Assigns `data.img_proxy_url` to `window.appConfig.IMGPROXY_URL`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\contexts\sitecatalystContext.jsx`** (Initial: 23/1/2026, 12:17:56, Update: 23/1/2026, 12:18:43, Update: 23/1/2026, 13:35:06):
    *   Manages Sitecatalyst (Adobe Analytics) tracking.
    *   **Initial state**: Sets `s.eVar23` and `s.prop23` to `${window.AppGlobal.platform}_${APP_NAME}`.
    *   **Update**: Changed `s.eVar23` and `s.prop23` to include a conditional for HbbTV: `${window.AppGlobal.platform === 'hbbtv' ? 'HbbTV' : 'SmartTV'}_${APP_NAME}`. This standardizes the platform naming for analytics (23/1/2026, 12:18:43).
    *   **Further Update**: Added `s.eVar10 = s.prop10 = s.eVar24 = s.prop24 = window.AppGlobal.platform;` to capture the raw platform value in additional eVars/props (23/1/2026, 13:35:06).

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Platform-Specific Configurations and Logic**: A strong pattern is the separation of logic and configuration based on target platforms (`tizen`, `webos`, `hbbtv`). This is evident in `build_templates` structure (e.g., `tizen/3cat_dev`, `webos/3cat_dev`), `gateway/js/app.js` files with different remote URLs, and platform detection/initialization in `platformUtils.js` and `platform.js`.
*   **Environment-Specific Deployments**: Builds are consistently categorized by environment (`DEV`, `PRE`, `PRO`), affecting remote URLs, app identifiers, and potentially signing profiles.
*   **Automated Packaging and Deployment**: The `package-launcher-apps.cjs` script and `package.json` scripts demonstrate a robust automated workflow for building and deploying applications, including versioning, date stamping, and GCS deployment.
*   **Image Handling and Optimization**: There's a dedicated `img.js` library for managing image URLs, selecting the "best" image based on various criteria (size, aspect ratio, format), and utilizing an image proxy (`IMGPROXY_URL`). This library was significantly refined to handle external images differently, ensuring they are not passed through the internal image proxy.
*   **User Interface and Navigation**: Changes in `App.jsx`, `platformUtils.js`, `generic.js`, and components like `PortraitItem` and `ExternalContentModal` show continuous work on UI rendering, keyboard navigation, and modal interactions tailored for Smart TV environments.
*   **Analytics Integration**: The `sitecatalystContext.jsx` highlights the integration with Adobe Analytics, capturing platform and user data for tracking application usage.
*   **Consistency in Naming and Structure**: An effort to standardize naming conventions (e.g., `App3Cat_DEV` to `3cat_dev`) is visible across template files.
*   **Focus on Debugging and Development Experience**: Inclusion of `ajsrConsole` logs and command-line prompts for binary versions indicates a focus on providing helpful feedback during development and packaging processes.
