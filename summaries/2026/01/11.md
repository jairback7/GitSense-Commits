# Activity Summary for 11/1/2026

## 3:28:24
The log details changes primarily within the `3cat_smarttv` project, focusing on UI components and their associated rendering logic and interaction.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx`** (Multiple changes on 7/1/2026 between 10:12:02 and 10:26:08):
    The main area of modification across these timestamps is the logic for **determining and assigning the `title` and `description`** for various media items within the `InfoGroup` component.
    *   **Initial State (10:12:02):** The title logic had a hierarchy checking `item.default_episode?.title`, `item.h2` (for non-audio), `item.presenter` (for live audio), and `item.title` for 'Tematics' live streams without a specific channel or for non-live items without a stream channel. A filter style on logo images for `link` collections was commented out, with a note about specific logos appearing black.
    *   **Subsequent Changes (10:17:32, 10:21:28, 10:23:36):** These timestamps show a continuous refinement of the `title` logic, particularly for 'Tematics' items (live streams without an `h2` title or a `stream?.channel`). The logic evolved from falling back to `item.description` only if `item.title` was also absent, to using `item.description` more generally for 'Tematics' unless it's a `link` collection.
    *   **Final Change (10:24:37, 10:26:08):** A new `else if` condition was introduced to explicitly handle cases where `item.title` should be used for live items. This condition was initially applied to *non-link* live items (`item.collection !== 'link'`) but was then inverted to apply *specifically to live items that are part of a `link` collection (`item.collection === 'link'`). This indicates a precise adjustment in title prioritization for different types of live content, especially those categorized as 'links'.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\index.jsx`** (Changes on 8/1/2026, from 11:36:05 to 11:49:43):
    *   The component was updated to introduce enhanced focus navigation control. A new `isFirstRow` prop was added.
    *   This `isFirstRow` prop is used to conditionally apply the `dataBlockFocusUp: 'true'` attribute to `RoundItem` components, effectively blocking upward focus navigation from items in the first row.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx`** (Timestamp: 8/1/2026, 11:48:50):
    This log entry provides a snapshot of the `RoundItem` component's structure. It highlights:
    *   Dynamic image selection (`round` or `logo` format) based on `isKidsProfile`.
    *   Use of `useEffect` for `registerFocusAction` and `unregisterFocusAction`, indicating a custom focus management system.
    *   Conditional rendering of either an image or the `item.title` as text if no suitable image is found.
    *   Application of various focus-blocking attributes (`dataBlockFocusUp`, `dataBlockFocusRight`, `dataBlockFocusLeft`, `dataOnLostLeftAction`, `dataBlockFocusDown`) based on props, allowing fine-grained control over navigation.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **7/1/2026, 10:12:02 - 10:26:08:** Multiple iterative changes to the title resolution logic in `infoGroup/index.jsx`. This block of timestamps indicates a focused session on refining how content titles are displayed based on various data points and content types.
*   **8/1/2026, 11:49:43:** Addition of `isFirstRow` prop and `dataBlockFocusUp` attribute in `roundRow/index.jsx`, signifying an improvement in UI navigation, specifically for the first row of content.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Focus Management:** There's a clear pattern of implementing a custom focus management system across UI components, particularly evident in `roundItem/index.jsx` with `registerFocusAction` and the use of `data-block-focus-*` HTML attributes in both `roundItem` and `roundRow`. This is crucial for Smart TV applications where navigation relies on directional input.
*   **Conditional Rendering and Logic:** Components frequently use conditional statements based on item properties (e.g., `isLive`, `isKidsProfile`, `item.collection`, `item.type`, `item.media_type`, `item.tag_format`, `item.default_episode`) to control visibility, content, and styling.
*   **Internationalization/Localization:** The presence of `useText` and date formatting utilities like `formatDateToCatalan`, `formatCatalanDayMonthWithLabelUTC` suggests the application supports or is built for multiple languages, with Catalan being a target.
*   **JIRA References:** Comments like `// JIRA CCMA-2104` and `// CCMA-1685` indicate an agile development process linked to a project tracking system, showing changes are often tied to specific tasks or bug fixes.
*   **`useMemo` Hook:** This React hook is consistently used to optimize performance by memoizing computed values (e.g., `logoImage`, `channelLogo`, `shouldShowProgramTitle`, `shouldShowEpisodeTitle`, `showTags`, `showDuration`), preventing unnecessary recalculations on re-renders.
*   **Live and External Content Handling:** Specific logic exists for detecting and displaying information related to "live" content (`isLive` function) and "external emission" (`useExternalEmission` hook), demonstrating specialized handling for dynamic and third-party streams.
