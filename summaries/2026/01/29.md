# Activity Summary for 29/1/2026

## 6:14:11
This log primarily captures a series of development and refinement activities on January 28, 2026, for a SmartTV application, with a strong focus on platform adaptability, user experience (including a "Kid Mode"), and general UI/UX enhancements.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`src\components\modals\exitAppModal\styles.kids.scss` (28/1/2026, 11:21:03):** Introduced or modified specific styling for the exit application modal when in "kid-mode." This includes changes to the modal's background, padding, title font size, and detailed button styling (height, border-radius, font size, line-height, margin, width, padding, border), particularly for its focused state.
*   **`src\App.jsx` (28/1/2026, 11:25:02):** This appears to be a major update to the application's core. It includes a vast array of imports for routes, contexts, components, and utilities, suggesting a comprehensive application structure. Key additions involve:
    *   Setting up global actions (`window.AppGlobal.Actions`).
    *   Debugging tools (`InitDevConsole`, `BuildInfo` component for displaying environment/build info, `DebugModalsLauncher`, `DebugConfigPane`).
    *   Extensive routing definitions using `react-router-dom` for public and private routes, covering various views like onboarding, content display, player, search, and configuration.
    *   Integration of numerous context providers (`AuthContextProvider`, `DidomiProvider`, `ParentalControlProvider`, etc.) to manage application state and features.
    *   Conditional rendering for HbbTV specific functionalities.
    *   Logic within `handleOk` to manage logout and application exit, including special handling for `UserType.KID`.
*   **`src\components\items\collectionItems\landscapeItem\index.jsx` (28/1/2026, 13:05:28 and 13:05:51):**
    *   The initial change involved a standard rendering of a landscape item with an image, optional title, and debug buttons.
    *   A subsequent minor update added a `bg-bottom-top-gradient` and wrapped the title within an `infoContainer` for enhanced visual presentation.
*   **`src\components\rows\genericRow\styles.scss` (28/1/2026, 13:06:46, 14:36:24, 14:52:00, 14:59:35):** This file underwent several styling adjustments for generic content rows:
    *   Initial comprehensive styling for various row types (e.g., HERO, BANNER, LANDSCAPE, SQUARE) and a "show all" item, defining layout, dimensions, and interactive states.
    *   The `line-height` for `.row-title` was adjusted from `29px` to `31px` (14:36:24).
    *   The `.item-show-all.LANDSCAPE` specific width and height styles were commented out (14:52:00), possibly to delegate styling to a more general rule or to temporarily disable it.
    *   A final entry shows no functional change (14:59:35).
*   **`src\router\navigationRoute.js` (28/1/2026, 13:13:07, 13:13:44, 14:32:50, 14:33:53):** The `getNavigationRoute` function, responsible for determining navigation URLs based on item properties, saw several iterations:
    *   An initial refactoring removed a complex conditional block for `collection` and `page/row` data types (13:13:07).
    *   This block was then re-introduced (13:13:44), restoring detailed logic for constructing routing parameters and URLs based on content metadata.
    *   New routing logic was added to explicitly handle `user_row` collection types (14:32:50).
    *   Finally, the routing conditions for `menu_link` and `user_row` collections were consolidated into a single, more concise statement (14:33:53).
*   **`src\components\items\rowItems\landscapeItem\styles.scss` (28/1/2026, 15:03:25):** A new, detailed styling file was introduced for `landscapeItem` components within rows. This includes comprehensive styles for the item itself, `external-content`, tags (like `live`), focused and hover states, gradients, platform-specific footer elements (logo, icon), and distinct text styles for `title` and `series-title`.
*   **`src\player\components\audioAndSubsMenu\index.jsx` (28/1/2026, 15:55:39):** A new component for managing audio and subtitle options within the player was implemented. It includes fetching audio/subtitle tracks from a `playerController`, handling user selection, managing focus, and applying "kid-mode" specific styling.
*   **`src\utils\platformUtils.js` (28/1/2026, 18:18:55):** A utility file dedicated to platform detection and configuration was significantly updated. It initializes a global `window.AppGlobal` object, provides functions to get user agent, detect platform (HbbTV, Tizen, WebOS, LG, html5), configure screen resolution, and retrieve OS versions. It dynamically loads WebOS-specific libraries if detected.
*   **`package.json` (28/1/2026, 18:29:40 and 18:29:48):**
    *   A new script `preview:sm` was added (18:29:40) with an output directory for `dist/webos`.
    *   This script was immediately corrected (18:29:48) to `preview:smarttv` with the `outDir` changed to `dist/smarttv`, indicating a quick fix for a build configuration.
*   **`3cat_pro\gateway\js\app.js` (28/1/2026, 18:31:53 and 18:52:08):** This gateway application for WebOS devices saw changes related to the remote application URL:
    *   Initially, the `REMOTE` URL was temporarily changed to a local development IP address (`http://192.168.1.138:4173/`), with a conditional fallback to the production URL for older SDK versions (18:31:53). This suggests local testing.
    *   Within minutes, the `REMOTE` URL was reverted back to the production URL (`https://smartv-pro.3cat.website/index.html`) at its initial declaration (18:52:08), implying the local testing change was quickly undone or corrected.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **"Kid Mode" Integration:** There's a clear recurring theme of incorporating "kid-mode" specific functionalities and styling, observed in `exitAppModal/styles.kids.scss`, `App.jsx` (exit logic), `navigationRoute.js` (custom action for child mode), and `audioAndSubsMenu` (importing kid styles). This highlights a dedicated effort to support a child-friendly user experience.
*   **Platform Specificity:** The application demonstrates a robust approach to supporting multiple SmartTV platforms. `App.jsx` and `platformUtils.js` contain logic for distinguishing and adapting to HbbTV, WebOS, Tizen, and LG devices. The `package.json` further reinforces this with distinct build and deployment scripts for `webos`, `tizen`, `hbbtv`, and generic `smarttv` hosted webapps across different environments (development, preproduction, production).
*   **UI/UX Refinement:** Frequent updates to SCSS files (`genericRow/styles.scss`, `landscapeItem/styles.scss`, `exitAppModal/styles.kids.scss`) indicate continuous refinement of the application's visual presentation, including layout adjustments, typography, and interactive states like hover and focus, often incorporating gradients and specific element positioning.
*   **Iterative Routing Logic:** The `navigationRoute.js` file shows an iterative process of refining and expanding the application's routing logic to accommodate new content types and ensure correct navigation paths.
*   **Focused Development Session:** All changes are timestamped on January 28, 2026, within a span of roughly seven hours, suggesting a concentrated development effort or a series of rapid adjustments.
