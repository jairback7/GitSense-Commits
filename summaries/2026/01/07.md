# Activity Summary for 7/1/2026

## 10:21:49
The log details changes to the file `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx`. This file appears to be a React component named `InfoGroup` responsible for displaying media information such as titles, descriptions, age ratings, durations, and various tags.

**File-specific updates in `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx`:**

The primary focus of the changes across the three timestamps is on refining the logic for determining the `title` of a media item within the `InfoGroup` component. Specifically, modifications were made to an `else if` condition that applies to "Tematics" (thematic content/streams) when the item is live, `item.h2` is not present, and `item.stream?.channel` is not defined.

*   **7/1/2026, 10:12:02**: In this version, for "Tematics" (live items where `h2` and `stream?.channel` are absent), the `title` was set to `item.title`.
*   **7/1/2026, 10:17:32**: The logic for "Tematics" was updated. If `item.h2` and `item.stream?.channel` were absent for a live item, and additionally `item.title` was *also* absent, then the `title` would be set to `item.description`.
*   **7/1/2026, 10:21:28**: The condition `!item.title` that was added at 10:17:32 was removed. This means that for "Tematics" (live items where `h2` and `stream?.channel` are absent), the `title` is now unconditionally set to `item.description`, regardless of whether `item.title` exists.

**Patterns and recurring elements:**
The changes demonstrate a rapid iterative adjustment to the content display logic, particularly concerning how fallback titles are handled for specific live stream types. The recurring element is the fine-tuning of the `title` assignment logic based on various properties of the `item` object, specifically `item.h2`, `item.stream?.channel`, `item.title`, and `item.description` for live, thematic content. This suggests an ongoing effort to ensure correct and robust title rendering under different data availability scenarios.
