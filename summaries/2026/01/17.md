The following outlines the key changes and patterns observed across the provided code logs:

**File: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\package-launcher-apps.cjs`**

This file, a Node.js script for packaging applications for WebOS and Tizen, underwent continuous development and refinement throughout the recorded timestamps (all on 14/1/2026, from 12:28:33 to 14:02:48).

*   **14/1/2026, 12:28:33**: The initial version established the core functionality. It defines utility functions for parsing CLI arguments (`--platform`, `--env`), date formatting, reading app information from `package.json`, and handling file system operations (creating/removing directories, listing/picking files). It included basic packaging logic for WebOS (using `ares-package`) and Tizen (using a temporary copy and `tizen package`), followed by renaming the output package to a standardized format.
*   **14/1/2026, 12:31:38**: This was a significant update.
    *   It introduced `readlineSync` for certificate prompting for Tizen `PRO` environment builds, allowing users to enter a profile name for signing.
    *   Crucially, it added **multi-resolution packaging for WebOS (LG)**. This involved iterating through `_720` and `_1080` resolutions, creating temporary directories for each, modifying `appinfo.json` to set `screenWidth` and `screenHeight` for the specific resolution, packaging with `ares-package`, and then renaming the resulting `.ipk` file with the resolution suffix.
*   **14/1/2026, 12:36:07**: Refactored the WebOS multi-resolution logic. The renaming and success logging for each WebOS package were moved inside its respective loop, ensuring each resolution-specific package is processed and confirmed immediately after creation. It also added a safeguard to unlink existing target paths before renaming.
*   **14/1/2026, 12:39:35**: The explicit `readlineSync` prompt for Tizen `PRO` environment signing was removed. Instead, the script now prints a message indicating that the `tizen CLI` is expected to prompt for the certificate if needed.
*   **14/1/2026, 12:48:19**: Modified the WebOS `appinfo.json` update. Instead of setting `screenWidth` and `screenHeight` separately, it now sets a single `appinfo.resolution` property (e.g., "1280x720"). Debugging logs were added for this change.
*   **14/1/2026, 12:54:31**: The WebOS package renaming strategy was altered. Instead of renaming each package immediately after creation, all packages for different resolutions are generated first, and then a separate loop iterates through the expected resolutions to find and rename the corresponding `.ipk` files. Additionally, the `appinfo.json` update for WebOS now also includes setting the `appinfo.version` from `package.json`. Function comments were removed in this version, though they reappeared in later commits.
*   **14/1/2026, 13:13:19**: Another significant update to Tizen signing.
    *   The `readline` module was introduced.
    *   A new `chooseTizenProfile` function was added to interactively list available Tizen security profiles (by executing `tizen security-profiles list`) and prompt the user to select one for signing `PRO` builds.
    *   The Tizen packaging flow was refactored to incorporate this interactive selection, passing the chosen profile name to the `tizen package` command using the `--sign` option.
*   **14/1/2026, 13:18:23** & **14/1/2026, 13:20:38**: Improvements were made to the `chooseTizenProfile` function to better parse the output of `tizen security-profiles list`, specifically extracting only the profile names and filtering out irrelevant lines.
*   **14/1/2026, 13:51:14**: Introduced logic to update the `version` attribute within the `config.xml` file for Tizen packages, ensuring the version from `package.json` is reflected. This modification happens in the temporary directory before packaging.
*   **14/1/2026, 13:56:41**: Refined the regex for updating `config.xml` to specifically target the `version` attribute within the `<widget>` tag, preventing unintended replacements.
*   **14/1/2026, 14:02:48**: Added an extra `fs.rmdirSync(tmpDirRes)` call after `removeDirRecursive` for WebOS temporary directories, providing a redundant cleanup step.

**File: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx`**

This React component is responsible for displaying various pieces of media information.

*   **14/1/2026, 14:17:53**: The component renders `MediaTag`, `MediaTitle`, `AgeRateImg`, `Duration`, `MediaSmallDescription`, and `MediaFeatures`. It includes internal helper components like `EpisodeCount` and `SeasonsCount`. Key functionalities include:
    *   `showExpiration`: Displays a "Disponible fins al/a l'" label for content expiring within three months.
    *   Dynamic logic to determine the correct `logoImage`, `channelLogo`, `duration`, `title`, and `description` based on the media item's properties (e.g., `is_live`, `is_episode`, `collection`).
    *   Conditional rendering for external content (showing platform logo, external live/white tags), upcoming events, and licensed status.
    *   A commented-out `Publication` component and related code indicate that the "A partir del" functionality (JIRA CCMA-2104) was intentionally removed.
*   **14/1/2026, 16:02:00**: No functional changes were observed in this entry; it appears to be a minor save or reformat.

**File: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\styles.scss`**

This SCSS file defines the styling for different types of rows within the application's UI.

*   **14/1/2026, 16:13:54**: This entry shows a comprehensive set of styles for a `.generic_row` element.
    *   It defines overall row properties like `width`, `margin-bottom`, and `overflow-y`.
    *   The `row-title` class sets styling for text, including font size, weight, line height, and color.
    *   Extensive use of SCSS nesting (`&.rowType_HERO`, `&.rowType_BANNER`, `&.rowType_LANDSCAPE`, etc.) to apply distinct padding, height, and width values based on the row type.
    *   Specific styles for `.externalRow` within `rowType_LANDSCAPE` and `rowType_LIVE_TV` are included.
    *   Detailed styling for an `.item-show-all` component, including its `show-all-icon` with a `plus-icon` sprite, and interactive `:hover` and `.focused` states that highlight the item with `$base-color-3cat-red` box-shadows and borders.
    *   The `.item-show-all` component's dimensions and icon positioning are adjusted for `.LANDSCAPE`, `.PORTRAIT`, and `.SQUARE` variants.
    *   Numerous commented-out properties (prefixed with `_`) suggest active development, layout experimentation, or debugging in progress.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Timestamp Focus**: All changes occurred on a single day (14/1/2026), indicating a concentrated period of development.
*   **Platform-Specific Logic**: The `package-launcher-apps.cjs` script consistently distinguishes and implements platform-specific packaging steps for WebOS and Tizen, adapting to their respective CLI tools and manifest file structures (`appinfo.json` for WebOS, `config.xml` for Tizen).
*   **Temporary Directories**: A recurring pattern in `package-launcher-apps.cjs` is the creation and subsequent removal of temporary directories (`tmp_webos_...`, `tmp_tizen_...`) to isolate build processes and keep source templates clean.
*   **Interactive CLI**: The packaging script evolved to include interactive elements (using `readline`) for user input, particularly for Tizen PRO environment signing, moving from a direct prompt to an interactive profile selection.
*   **Version Management**: Both the WebOS (`appinfo.json`) and Tizen (`config.xml`) packaging steps were updated to explicitly inject the package version from `package.json`, ensuring consistency.
*   **UI Component Design**: The `index.jsx` component demonstrates robust conditional rendering and memoization (`useMemo`) for performance, typical of React application development.
*   **Styling Structure**: The `styles.scss` file showcases a modular and hierarchical approach to styling, using nested rules and type-specific modifiers, indicating a structured front-end development workflow.
*   **Debugging/Refinement**: The presence of debug logs (`console.log('DEBUG: ...')`) and commented-out/prefixed CSS properties (`_background-color`) suggests an iterative development and debugging process.
