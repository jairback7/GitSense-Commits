# Activity Summary for 31/1/2026

## 1:03:12
The provided log details a series of code changes, primarily focusing on keyboard navigation, platform-specific integrations, and user consent management for a Smart TV application. All recorded changes occurred on January 30, 2026, indicating a focused development session.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\styles.scss` (Timestamp: 30/1/2026, 9:04:15)**
    *   This file defines the base styling for the main application page (`.page_view`) and a bottom gradient element (`.bottom-gradient`).
    *   The `.page_view` is configured with a fixed resolution (1920x1080px), absolute positioning, and a background image (`3cat_red-bg_1920x270.png`). It also includes styling for a `.rankingText` element.
    *   The `.bottom-gradient` is a fixed overlay at the bottom of the screen with a mask image (`mask_1080.png`).
    *   This entry appears to be an initial or static definition of these core UI styles.

2.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (Multiple timestamps)**
    *   **Initial state (30/1/2026, 11:38:08 & 11:38:42):** Introduces `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartTV` to handle keyboard input common to most Smart TV platforms, as well as specific handling for WebOS and Tizen. It defines `window.AppGlobal.KeyMemory` for processing key combinations (e.g., specific sequences for enabling/disabling ads). Player controls (Play, Pause, Stop, Rewind, Fast Forward) initially call methods from `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller`. The `dispatchFastForwardEvent` and `dispatchRewindEvent` functions had a syntax error (`return const event`).
    *   **WebOS Player Control Update (30/1/2026, 11:53:37):** A `VK_PLAY_PAUSE` key handler was added for WebOS, calling `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.togglePlayPause()`. This marks the first instance of using the `Actions` object for player control in this file.
    *   **Player API Refactoring (30/1/2026, 12:29:17 & 12:29:26):** Player control calls for WebOS (`Play`, `Pause`, `Stop`) were refactored from `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions`. For Tizen, the `Play` action was also moved to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.play()`, but `Pause` and `Stop` continued to use `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller.pause()`.

3.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\keycodes.js` (Timestamp: 30/1/2026, 11:54:49)**
    *   This file was introduced to define `KeyCodes` specific to the HbbTV platform. It uses `window.KeyEvent?.VK_KEY ?? fallback_value` for robustness, providing default key codes if `window.KeyEvent` is not available. This includes directional keys, colored buttons (RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE), and various player controls.

4.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\hbbtv.js` (Multiple timestamps)**
    *   **Initial state (30/1/2026, 11:55:42, 11:55:54 & 11:56:04):** Implemented `initAppHbbTV` for HbbTV application initialization, including an `evExitApplication` listener. The `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartHbbTV` function handles HbbTV-specific key presses, registering them via `app.privateData.keyset`. Player controls (`VK_PLAY`, `VK_PAUSE`, `VK_STOP`, `VK_REWIND`, `VK_FAST_FWD`) initially used `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` methods (e.g., `seekMinus10Seconds`), while `VK_PLAY_PAUSE` used `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.togglePlayPause()`.
    *   **Player API Refactoring (30/1/2026, 12:29:39):** All explicit player control calls (`play`, `pause`, `stop`, `seekMinus10Seconds`, `seekPlus10Seconds`) were refactored to use `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` methods instead of `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller`.
    *   **Seek Event Dispatching (30/1/2026, 12:33:41):** The `VK_REWIND` and `VK_FAST_FWD` key handlers were updated to dispatch `customSeekKeyDown` events via newly defined local `dispatchRewindEvent` and `dispatchFastForwardEvent` functions, rather than directly calling `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.seek...`. This aligns the HbbTV platform's seek event handling with the pattern seen in `generic.js`.

5.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\contexts\didomiContext.jsx` (Multiple timestamps)**
    *   **Initial state (30/1/2026, 12:20:04 & 12:20:41):** Introduced `DidomiContext` and `DidomiProvider` to manage user consent (Didomi SDK) and an exit application modal. It tracks the visibility of the Didomi notice and preferences, handles specific key presses (Back/Exit) to interact with the consent UI, and conditionally renders `children` when the Didomi notice is not displayed. The `ExtraAppModals` component was imported but not rendered.
    *   **Rendering `ExtraAppModals` (30/1/2026, 12:21:34):** The `ExtraAppModals` component was added to the rendered output of the `DidomiProvider`, appearing unconditionally.

6.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (Timestamp: 30/1/2026, 12:29:46)**
    *   This file defines comprehensive Tizen platform integration. It initializes the Tizen app, manages device information, and sets up listeners for `visibilitychange` (pausing/playing media and exiting the app as needed) and `evExitApplication`.
    *   It includes a `initNetworkStateListener` to detect network disconnections and display a "NO\_CONNECTION" modal.
    *   Functions for screen saver management (`initScreenSaverHelpers`), registration of extra Samsung TV remote keys (`initExtraSamsungKeys`), and launching other Tizen applications or the Samsung Store (`launchAppTizen`, `openSamsungStore`) are also defined. Player control calls consistently use `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Platform Abstraction and Specialization:** The code base shows a clear pattern of abstracting common functionalities (like keyboard navigation) while providing specialized implementations for different Smart TV platforms (WebOS, Tizen, HbbTV) and a generic fallback.
*   **`window.AppGlobal` Usage:** A central `window.AppGlobal` object is used extensively to store global application state, player controls, key combination logic (`KeyMemory`), and various actions (`Actions`).
*   **Player API Refactoring:** A significant recurring change across `generic.js` and `hbbtv.js` is the migration of player control methods from a `Controller` object to an `Actions` object within `window.AppGlobal.Player`. This suggests a refactoring effort to standardize and simplify player interactions.
*   **Keyboard Event Handling:** All platform-specific files include detailed `keydown` event listeners with key throttling, custom event dispatching (`customKeyDown`, `customNavigation`, `customSeekKeyDown`), and complex `switch` statements to map physical key codes to application actions.
*   **Exit Application Logic:** There's a consistent pattern for handling application exit, often triggered by a custom `evExitApplication` event and involving `goBackHistory` alongside platform-specific methods to terminate the application.
*   **Didomi Consent Integration:** A dedicated React Context (`didomiContext.jsx`) is used for managing user consent, indicating a focus on GDPR compliance or similar regulatory requirements, with specific UI and key handling logic.
*   **Consistent Logging:** The use of `ajsrConsole.log` (or `console.log`) throughout the platform files suggests a verbose logging strategy for debugging and tracking execution flow.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** All changes occurring on the same date within a few hours (between 9 AM and 1 PM) point to a concentrated development or debugging session, possibly addressing multiple issues or implementing a new feature in a short timeframe.

## 6:05:13
The provided log details a series of code changes, primarily focused on keyboard navigation and platform-specific functionalities for a Smart TV application. All changes occurred on **30/1/2026**.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\styles.scss` (30/1/2026, 9:04:15)**:
    *   This file defines the styling for the `.page_view` and `.bottom-gradient` elements.
    *   `.page_view` is styled with a `3cat_red-bg_1920x270.png` background, positioned absolutely, and has a fixed width/height (1920x1080px). It also includes styling for `.rankingText` (absolute position, italic font, specific color).
    *   `.bottom-gradient` is fixed at the bottom with a `mask_1080.png` background.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (Multiple timestamps: 11:38:08, 11:38:42, 11:53:37, 12:29:17, 12:29:26)**:
    *   This file manages generic keyboard navigation for Smart TV platforms.
    *   **Initial Setup (11:38:08)**: Imports `goBackHistory` and `KeyCodes`. It initializes `window.AppGlobal.KeyMemory` to track key combinations and defines `window.AppGlobal.keyCombinations` for specific actions like enabling/disabling ads based on key sequences (e.g., "979899" for ads on, "999897" for ads off). The `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartTV` function sets up a throttled `onKeyDownHandler` to process common Smart TV keys (navigation, ENTER, BACK, numeric) and dispatches custom events. Player-related keys are handled, with different implementations for WebOS, Tizen, and other platforms.
    *   **Minor Save (11:38:42)**: No functional code changes observed compared to the previous entry.
    *   **WebOS Player Key Update (11:53:37)**: A new case `window.KeyEvent?.VK_PLAY_PAUSE || 0x52` was added to the WebOS-specific key handling to call `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.togglePlayPause()`. This introduced a slight inconsistency as other WebOS player controls still used `Player.Controller`.
    *   **Refactor: WebOS Player Actions (12:29:17)**: The `play`, `pause`, and `stop` actions for WebOS were refactored to use `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` instead of `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller`, standardizing the API calls for player control within WebOS.
    *   **Refactor: Tizen Player Actions (12:29:26)**: Similarly, the `play`, `pause`, and `stop` actions for Tizen were updated to use `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` instead of `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller`, enhancing consistency across platforms.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\keycodes.js` (30/1/2026, 11:54:49)**:
    *   This new file defines a `KeyCodes` object specific to HbbTV. It maps common Smart TV keys (navigation, colored buttons, media controls, numeric) to their HbbTV `window.KeyEvent` values, providing numeric fallbacks if `window.KeyEvent` is unavailable.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\hbbtv.js` (Multiple timestamps: 11:55:42, 11:55:54, 11:56:04, 12:29:39, 12:33:41)**:
    *   This file provides HbbTV-specific application and keyboard navigation logic.
    *   **Initial Implementation (11:55:42)**: Imports `KeyCodes` and `goBackHistory`. `initAppHbbTV` sets up device logging and an `evExitApplication` listener. `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartHbbTV` registers necessary keys with the HbbTV application's keyset mask (navigation, VCR, colored buttons) and defines a `processKey` function to handle these. Media controls (Play, Pause, Stop, Rewind, Fast Forward) initially used `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` methods for seeking.
    *   **Minor Saves (11:55:54, 11:56:04)**: No functional code changes were introduced in these saves, primarily related to destructuring `KeyCodes` further for `VK_PLAY_PAUSE`.
    *   **Refactor: HbbTV Player Actions (12:29:39)**: All player control actions (`play`, `pause`, `stop`, `seekMinus10Seconds`, `seekPlus10Seconds`) were updated from using `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` methods to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` methods, aligning with changes in `generic.js`.
    *   **Refactor: HbbTV Seek Events (12:33:41)**: Introduced `dispatchFastForwardEvent` and `dispatchRewindEvent` helper functions. The `VK_REWIND` and `VK_FAST_FWD` cases in the `processKey` function were updated to call these new dispatch functions, standardizing how seek events are triggered.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\contexts\didomiContext.jsx` (Multiple timestamps: 12:20:04, 12:20:41, 12:21:34)**:
    *   This file implements a React Context for Didomi, a consent management platform.
    *   **Initial Implementation (12:20:04)**: Defines `DidomiContext` and `DidomiProvider`. It manages the visibility of the Didomi notice and preferences, handling keydown events (especially the `BACK` key) to navigate consent modals or close them. It registers various listeners for Didomi SDK events (`notice.hidden`, `preferences.shown`, `preferences.hidden`, click events) and conditionally renders application children or an `ExitAppModal` based on consent visibility.
    *   **Minor Save (12:20:41)**: No functional code changes observed.
    *   **Modal Inclusion (12:21:34)**: The `ExtraAppModals` component was added to be rendered within the `DidomiContext.Provider`, indicating the integration of additional application-specific modals.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (30/1/2026, 12:29:46)**:
    *   This file provides Tizen-specific platform functionalities.
    *   It includes functions to fetch Tizen device information, initialize the app, and handle application lifecycle events (`visibilitychange` for pausing/resuming playback).
    *   It implements a network state listener to detect disconnections and display a "NO_CONNECTION" modal.
    *   The file manages screen saver functionality (`enableScreenSaver`, `disableScreenSaver`) using Tizen's `webapis.appcommon`.
    *   `initExtraSamsungKeys` registers a comprehensive list of extra Samsung TV remote keys (media, color, numeric, channel) for the application.
    *   Functions `launchAppTizen` and `openSamsungStore` are provided for interacting with other applications or the Samsung app store.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Cross-Platform Keyboard Navigation:** A significant effort is dedicated to handling keyboard input across generic Smart TV, WebOS, Tizen, and HbbTV platforms. This includes key code mapping, event throttling, and dispatching custom navigation and media control events.
*   **Player API Standardization:** A clear pattern of refactoring emerged where `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` method calls were consistently migrated to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` across `generic.js`, `hbbtv.js`, and `tizen.js`. This indicates a move towards a unified or preferred API for player interactions.
*   **Consent Management Integration (Didomi):** The `DidomiContext` demonstrates a comprehensive integration of a consent management platform, handling UI toggling, event listeners, and interaction with app navigation (e.g., `BACK` key).
*   **Platform-Specific Device Interaction:** Each platform file (`generic.js`, `hbbtv.js`, `tizen.js`) shows code tailored to its environment for tasks like device information retrieval, app lifecycle management, and specific API calls (e.g., `app.privateData.keyset` for HbbTV, `tizen.tvinputdevice.registerKey` for Tizen, `webapis.network` for Tizen).
*   **Ad Control:** Direct key combinations are provided in `generic.js` to enable or disable ads, suggesting in-app debugging or testing capabilities for ad integration.
*   **Extensive Logging:** Frequent use of `ajsrConsole.log` and `console.log` throughout the files indicates a strong emphasis on debugging and tracing application flow, especially for platform-specific behaviors and key presses.
*   **Custom Event Dispatching:** The application leverages `CustomEvent` for various interactions (e.g., `customKeyDown`, `customNavigation`, `customSeekKeyDown`), promoting a decoupled and event-driven architecture.

## 11:06:57
The changes span from 30/1/2026, 9:04:15 to 30/1/2026, 12:33:41, across several files related to Smart TV application development, focusing on platform-specific integrations, keyboard navigation, and UI components.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\styles.scss` (30/1/2026, 9:04:15):** This file defines the visual styles for a `page_view` element. It sets a background image (`3cat_red-bg_1920x270.png`), positions elements absolutely, and styles a `rankingText` within it. It also defines a `bottom-gradient` using a `mask_1080.png` image. This appears to be a foundational style definition for a page layout.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (Multiple timestamps: 30/1/2026, 11:38:08 - 12:29:26):** This file is central to generic keyboard navigation for Smart TV platforms.
    *   **30/1/2026, 11:53:37:** A significant update introduced a `VK_PLAY_PAUSE` key handler for the WebOS platform, allowing `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.togglePlayPause()` to be called.
    *   **30/1/2026, 12:29:17:** Multiple player control actions were refactored. Specifically, calls to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller.play()`, `pause()`, and `stop()` were updated to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.play()`, `pause()`, and `stop()` for both WebOS and Tizen platform-specific key handling blocks.
    *   The file manages a `KeyMemory` for key combinations, dispatches `customKeyDown`, `customKeyUp`, `customNavigation`, and `customSeekKeyDown` events, and includes logic for handling back/exit keys, including interaction with a `Didomi` consent modal.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\keycodes.js` (30/1/2026, 11:54:49):** This file was added or significantly updated to define a `KeyCodes` object for HbbTV, mapping generic key names (like `VK_LEFT`, `VK_PLAY`) to their respective numeric key codes, often with a fallback if `window.KeyEvent` is not available. The addition of `VK_PLAY_PAUSE` (0x52) is notable, aligning with the `generic.js` update.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\hbbtv.js` (Multiple timestamps: 30/1/2026, 11:55:42 - 12:33:41):** This file handles HbbTV platform-specific initialization and keyboard navigation.
    *   **30/1/2026, 11:56:04:** `VK_PLAY_PAUSE` was added to the destructured `KeyCodes` import, preparing for its use.
    *   **30/1/2026, 12:29:39:** Similar to `generic.js`, player control actions for HbbTV were refactored from `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller.ACTION()` to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.ACTION()` for play, pause, stop, rewind, and fast-forward.
    *   **30/1/2026, 12:33:41:** The `VK_REWIND` and `VK_FAST_FWD` key handlers were updated to dispatch `customSeekKeyDown` events via dedicated `dispatchRewindEvent()` and `dispatchFastForwardEvent()` functions, rather than directly calling player actions.
    *   The file includes functions for HbbTV application lifecycle, device information, key registration, and handling of colored buttons specific to HbbTV remotes.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\contexts\didomiContext.jsx` (Multiple timestamps: 30/1/2026, 12:20:04 - 12:21:34):** This React context manages the Didomi consent management platform (CMP) integration.
    *   **30/1/2026, 12:21:34:** The primary change was the addition of the `<ExtraAppModals/>` component within the `DidomiContext.Provider`, indicating new or extended modal functionality being integrated into the application's UI structure.
    *   It handles the display and hiding of Didomi notices and preferences, manages exit modals, and integrates with global keydown events, specifically for back/exit keys.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (30/1/2026, 12:29:46):** This extensive file details the integration for the Tizen platform. It covers:
    *   Device information retrieval (`tizen.systeminfo`).
    *   Application lifecycle management, including handling `visibilitychange` (pausing/playing video, history navigation) and `evExitApplication`.
    *   Network state monitoring (`webapis.network`), which can trigger a "NO_CONNECTION" modal.
    *   Screen saver control (`webapis.appcommon.setScreenSaver`).
    *   Registration of various Samsung TV remote keys ('MediaPlay', 'MediaPause', color keys, numeric keys, channel keys) using `tizen.tvinputdevice.registerKey`.
    *   Functions for launching other Tizen applications (`launchAppTizen`) and opening the Samsung App Store (`openSamsungStore`).
    *   Consistent with other platform files, it uses `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.ACTION()` for player controls.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Player Control API Refactor:** A consistent pattern across `generic.js`, `hbbtv.js`, and `tizen.js` is the refactoring of player control calls from `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller.ACTION()` to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.ACTION()` (e.g., `.play()`, `.pause()`, `.stop()`). This suggests a move towards a unified or updated player action API.
*   **Platform-Specific Key Handling:** All `platform` files (`generic.js`, `hbbtv.js`, `tizen.js`) implement detailed keyboard navigation and event handling tailored to their respective environments, including common keys (navigation, enter) and platform-specific keys (media controls, colored buttons).
*   **Custom Event Dispatching:** The use of `CustomEvent` (e.g., `customKeyDown`, `customNavigation`, `customSeekKeyDown`) is prevalent for propagating keypresses and navigation events throughout the application, allowing for a decoupled event-driven architecture.
*   **Global `window.AppGlobal` Object:** The application relies heavily on a global `window.AppGlobal` object to store shared state, key combination logic, player references, and action functions, indicating a global state management approach.
*   **Exit/Back Key Handling:** A common theme is the handling of back/exit keys (`VK_BACK`, `VK_ESCAPE`, platform-specific codes like `461` for WebOS, `10009` for Tizen, `88` for Hisense). This often involves `goBackHistory` and potentially opening an `ExitAppModal` or handling a `Didomi` consent screen, demonstrating careful management of app termination or navigation behavior.
*   **`ajsrConsole.log`:** Numerous console logs prefixed with `[Key]`, `[Platform]`, `[APP]`, etc., using `ajsrConsole.log`, suggest a custom logging utility is in place for detailed debugging and tracing of platform interactions and key events.

## 12:06:59
The changes log details updates across styling, core platform logic, and context management for a Smart TV application.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\styles.scss` (30/1/2026, 9:04:15)**:
    This file defines the base styling for a `.page_view` element, including a background image (`3cat_red-bg_1920x270.png`), absolute positioning, fixed dimensions (1920x1080px), and a nested `.rankingText` style. It also defines a `.bottom-gradient` with a background image (`mask_1080.png`), fixed position, and specific dimensions. This appears to be a foundational style definition for a page layout.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js`**:
    *   **Initially (30/1/2026, 11:38:08 & 11:38:42)**: Establishes a generic keyboard navigation system for Smart TVs, including key throttling, a `KeyMemory` for combinations, and common key handlers (up, down, left, right, enter, back/escape). It already includes platform-specific key handling for WebOS and Tizen, and a fallback for other platforms (excluding HbbTV). Player control functions (`window.AppGlobal.Player.Ads.enabedAds()`, `disabledAds()`, `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller.play()`, `pause()`, etc.) are present.
    *   **Update (30/1/2026, 11:53:37)**: An additional case for `window.KeyEvent?.VK_PLAY_PAUSE || 0x52` was added within the WebOS-specific key handling, enabling `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.togglePlayPause()` for a combined play/pause key.
    *   **Update (30/1/2026, 12:29:17)**: Refactored player control calls within the WebOS-specific key handling. `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller.play()`, `Controller.pause()`, etc., were changed to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.play()`, `Actions.pause()`, etc., for Play, Pause, and Stop actions.
    *   **Update (30/1/2026, 12:29:26)**: Further refactoring of player control calls. Specifically, within the Tizen-specific key handling, the `Play` action (`case 415`) was changed from `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller.play()` to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.play()`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\keycodes.js` (30/1/2026, 11:54:49)**:
    This file defines a `KeyCodes` object for HbbTV, mapping common key names (e.g., `VK_LEFT`, `VK_PLAY`, `VK_RED`) to their respective key codes, with a fallback value if `window.KeyEvent` is not available. This centralizes HbbTV-specific key code definitions.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\hbbtv.js`**:
    *   **Initially (30/1/2026, 11:55:42 & 11:55:54)**: Provides HbbTV-specific application initialization (`initAppHbbTV`) and keyboard navigation (`IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartHbbTV`). It registers HbbTV keys (navigation, VCR, color keys) and handles keydown events to control application flow (e.g., `goBackHistory`, `app.destroyApplication`) and player actions.
    *   **Update (30/1/2026, 11:56:04)**: The `VK_PLAY_PAUSE` key constant was added to the destructuring assignment from `KeyCodes`, making it available for use in HbbTV key handling.
    *   **Update (30/1/2026, 12:29:39)**: Refactored player control calls within the `processKey` function. `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller.play()`, `Controller.pause()`, `Controller.seekMinus10Seconds()`, `Controller.seekPlus10Seconds()`, etc., were all changed to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.play()`, `Actions.pause()`, `Actions.seekMinus10Seconds()`, `Actions.seekPlus10Seconds()`, respectively, for all media control keys.
    *   **Update (30/1/2026, 12:33:41)**: Modified the `VK_REWIND` and `VK_FAST_FWD` key handlers. Instead of directly calling player seek actions, they now dispatch `customSeekKeyDown` events (`dispatchRewindEvent()`, `dispatchFastForwardEvent()`). The `dispatchFastForwardEvent` and `dispatchRewindEvent` utility functions were also moved into this file from what was previously implied to be a more generic location (likely `generic.js`).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\contexts\didomiContext.jsx`**:
    *   **Initially (30/1/2026, 12:20:04 & 12:20:41)**: Defines a React context (`DidomiContext`) and provider (`DidomiProvider`) for managing Didomi consent notices and modals. It handles the visibility of the Didomi notice, including displaying an `ExitAppModal` when appropriate, and integrates with the Didomi SDK's lifecycle events. It also intercepts specific keydown events (e.g., Back key codes) to manage consent notice views.
    *   **Update (30/1/2026, 12:21:34)**: The `<ExtraAppModals/>` component was added to the `DidomiContext.Provider`'s render output, indicating the integration of additional application modals within this context.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (30/1/2026, 12:29:46)**:
    This file provides comprehensive Tizen platform-specific functionalities. It includes initialization (`initAppTizen`), retrieves device information, manages application lifecycle events (visibility change, exit), handles network state changes, provides screen saver control (`initScreenSaverHelpers`), and registers extra Samsung TV remote keys. It also contains functions for launching other Tizen applications and opening the Samsung App Store.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Platform-Specific Implementations**: A strong pattern is the segregation of code into platform-specific files (`generic.js`, `hbbtv.js`, `tizen.js`, `hbbtv/keycodes.js`). This indicates an architecture designed to support multiple Smart TV platforms, each with its unique APIs and key codes.
2.  **Keyboard Navigation and Event Handling**: A central theme is robust keyboard navigation. All platform files (`generic.js`, `hbbtv.js`) heavily feature `onKeyDownHandler` or `handleKeyDown` functions that process `e.keyCode` values. Key combinations are managed, and events like `customNavigation` and `customSeekKeyDown` are dispatched. A `THROTTLE_MS` (200ms) is used in `generic.js` to prevent rapid key presses, and `window.AppGlobal.keyFuntionsInit` prevents re-initialization.
3.  **Player Control Abstraction**: There's a recurring refactoring pattern where direct calls to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller.something()` are being replaced with `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.something()`. This suggests a shift towards a more abstracted or action-based player API, indicating an effort to standardize player interactions across different platforms or modules.
4.  **Global Application State (`window.AppGlobal`)**: The `window.AppGlobal` object is consistently used to store and access global application state and functions, including `KeyMemory`, `keyCombinations`, `Player` controls, `Actions`, `platform`, `ScreenSaver`, and `keyFuntionsInit`.
5.  **Modal and Exit Management**: Both `generic.js` and `didomiContext.jsx` show logic for handling exit scenarios. The `generic.js` intercepts "Back" keys to open an `ExitAppModal` if `window.displayingDidomi` is false. `didomiContext.jsx` also uses back keys to manage its own modal views and dispatches an `evExitApplication` event, which is then handled by platform-specific listeners in `hbbtv.js` and `tizen.js` to destroy or exit the application.
6.  **Custom Events**: Custom events (`customKeyDown`, `customKeyUp`, `customNavigation`, `customSeekKeyDown`, `evExitApplication`) are frequently dispatched, indicating an event-driven architecture for communication between different parts of the application.
7.  **Debugging and Logging**: Extensive use of `ajsrConsole.log` and `console.log` with descriptive prefixes (e.g., `[Key]`, `[Platform][HbbTV]`, `[APP]`) is present across almost all JavaScript files, highlighting a focus on detailed logging for development and debugging.

**File: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\styles.scss` (Timestamp: 30/1/2026, 9:04:15)**
This file defines the basic styling for a `.page_view` element, setting its background image (`3cat_red-bg_1920x270.png`), positioning, and dimensions to fill a 1920x1080 area. It also styles a `.rankingText` with specific font properties and position, and a `.bottom-gradient` element using `mask_1080.png` for a fixed gradient effect at the bottom of the screen.

**File: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js`**
This file handles generic keyboard navigation and player control across Smart TV platforms, undergoing several updates on **30/1/2026**.
*   **Initial State (11:38:08 & 11:38:42):** It initializes a global `window.AppGlobal` object for key memory and combinations. `KeyMemory` tracks the last three key presses to execute predefined combinations (e.g., "979899" to enable ads, "999897" to disable ads). The `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartTV` function sets up a `keydown` handler with a throttle (`THROTTLE_MS = 200`). It includes common navigation keys (Up, Down, Left, Right, Enter), a back key (handling exit modals or `goBackHistory`), and numeric keys. Platform-specific sections handle player controls for WebOS, Tizen, and other non-HbbTV platforms, initially using `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` for WebOS and a mix of `Controller` and `Actions` for Tizen and other platforms. Custom events (`customKeyDown`, `customNavigation`, `customSeekKeyDown`) are dispatched. Notably, the `dispatchFastForwardEvent` and `dispatchRewindEvent` functions contained a `return` statement immediately after their declaration, preventing their functionality.
*   **WebOS Player Key Update (11:53:37):** A new case for `VK_PLAY_PAUSE` (0x52) was added within the WebOS-specific key handling, directing to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.togglePlayPause()`. This introduced a `VK_PLAY_PAUSE` action for WebOS.
*   **Player Actions Unification (12:29:17 & 12:29:26):** Player control calls for WebOS (Play, Pause, Stop) and Tizen (Play) were updated to consistently use `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` (e.g., `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.play()` instead of `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller.play()`). The bug in `dispatchFastForwardEvent` and `dispatchRewindEvent` with the immediate `return` statement persists in these versions.

**File: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\keycodes.js` (Timestamp: 30/1/2026, 11:54:49)**
This file defines a `KeyCodes` object specific to the HbbTV platform. It provides a mapping for various keys (navigation, color buttons, media controls, numeric) using `window.KeyEvent?.VK_KEYNAME ?? FALLBACK_VALUE`, ensuring compatibility by using platform-native key codes if available, or defaulting to a hexadecimal or decimal fallback.

**File: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\hbbtv.js`**
This file implements HbbTV-specific application and keyboard initialization, seeing several updates on **30/1/2026**.
*   **Initial State (11:55:42 & 11:55:54):** It includes `initAppHbbTV` for device logging and attaching an `evExitApplication` listener to destroy the HbbTV app. `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartHbbTV` registers HbbTV remote keys (color keys, navigation, VCR controls) using the HbbTV application's private data keyset. The `handleKeyDown` and `processKey` functions manage navigation, color button actions, the back key (to exit the app), and player controls, initially using `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller.play/pause/seek`. The `VK_PLAY_PAUSE` case correctly used `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.togglePlayPause()`. The `dispatchFastForwardEvent` and `dispatchRewindEvent` functions were called but not defined within this file's scope.
*   **KeyCodes Import Fix (11:56:04):** The `VK_PLAY_PAUSE` constant was added to the destructured import from `KeyCodes` at the top of the file, rectifying a potential `undefined` error.
*   **Player Actions Unification (12:29:39):** Player control calls for Play, Pause, Stop, Rewind, and Fast Forward were updated to use `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` consistently (e.g., `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.play()`, `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.seekMinus10Seconds()`). The `dispatchFastForwardEvent` and `dispatchRewindEvent` remained undefined.
*   **Dispatch Function Definition (12:33:41):** The `dispatchFastForwardEvent` and `dispatchRewindEvent` functions were finally defined within the `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartHbbTV` scope, resolving the previous bug. These functions now correctly dispatch `customSeekKeyDown` events.

**File: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\contexts\didomiContext.jsx`**
This React context manages the display and interaction with a Didomi consent modal and an exit application modal.
*   **Initial State (12:20:04 & 12:20:41):** It uses `useState` and `useRef` to manage the visibility of an exit modal, the Didomi notice, and internal states related to user consent. The `switchNoticeModalViews` function toggles the display of the Didomi notice and the exit modal. An `useEffect` hook handles Didomi SDK initialization, setting up listeners for Didomi events (shown, hidden, click events on preferences). A `handleKeyDown` function specifically manages the "Back" key interaction (key codes 8, 88, 461, 10009) to navigate Didomi preferences or toggle the notice. It conditionally renders child components only when the Didomi notice is not displayed and renders an `ExitAppModal` when `exitModalOpened` is true.
*   **Additional Modals (12:21:34):** The `<ExtraAppModals/>` component was added to the rendered output, indicating the integration of another layer for application-specific modals.

**File: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (Timestamp: 30/1/2026, 12:29:46)**
This file provides comprehensive Tizen-specific platform integration. It includes `initAppTizen` for device information retrieval, lifecycle management (handling `visibilitychange` to pause/play the player), and application exit. `initNetworkStateListener` monitors network connectivity, displaying a "NO_CONNECTION" modal on disconnection. It defines helpers for `webapis.appcommon` (`hasTizenAppCommon`, `debugTizenAppCommon`) and `initScreenSaverHelpers` to manage the screen saver. Crucially, `initExtraSamsungKeys` registers a wide range of additional Samsung TV Remote keys (media, color, numeric, channel) for the application to handle. Finally, it provides `launchAppTizen` and `openSamsungStore` functions for interacting with other Tizen apps or the app store.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Platform Specialization:** A strong pattern of separating code by platform (generic, HbbTV, Tizen) for specific device interactions, particularly keyboard navigation and player controls, is evident.
*   **Centralized Global State:** The `window.AppGlobal` object serves as a central hub for application-wide state, player controls, and key function initialization across different platform files.
*   **Keyboard Navigation Consistency:** Common navigation keys (Up, Down, Left, Right, Enter, Back) are handled across `generic.js` and `hbbtv.js`, often dispatching custom navigation events.
*   **Player Control Abstraction:** There's an observable shift towards unifying player control calls under `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` across platforms, moving away from `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller`.
*   **Custom Event Usage:** Extensive use of `CustomEvent` (e.g., `customKeyDown`, `customNavigation`, `customSeekKeyDown`, `evExitApplication`) facilitates loose coupling between different parts of the application.
*   **Consent Management Integration:** The `didomiContext.jsx` highlights the integration of a third-party consent management system, complete with modal handling and specific keyboard interactions.
*   **Iterative Development:** The multiple timestamps for the same files within short timeframes (seconds to minutes) suggest active, iterative development, including minor adjustments, bug fixes, and refactoring efforts. Some entries with identical code indicate potential resaves or non-functional commits.

## 22:09:50
The code changes primarily occurred on **January 30, 2026**, focusing on keyboard navigation, platform-specific integrations, and consent management for a Smart TV application.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\styles.scss` (Timestamp: 09:04:15)**
    *   This file defines the basic layout and styling for a "page view." It sets up a full-screen `.page_view` with a background image, absolute positioning, and a `.rankingText` element. It also defines a `.bottom-gradient` with a background image.

2.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (Timestamps: 11:38:08, 11:38:42, 11:53:37, 12:29:17, 12:29:26)**
    *   **Initial Setup (11:38:08):** Established a comprehensive keyboard navigation system for Smart TVs. This includes `window.AppGlobal.KeyMemory` to track key combinations for actions like enabling/disabling ads. The `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartTV` function handles common keys (arrow keys, Enter, Back/Escape) and platform-specific player controls for WebOS and Tizen. It dispatches custom events for navigation and seeking.
    *   **Minor Update (11:53:37):** Enhanced WebOS key handling by adding support for a `PLAY_PAUSE` key (`window.KeyEvent?.VK_PLAY_PAUSE || 0x52`), mapping it to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.togglePlayPause()`.
    *   **Refactoring Player Actions (12:29:17):** Standardized player control calls for WebOS (Play, Pause, Stop) and the Tizen Play key from `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions`. This aimed for consistency in how player commands are issued.
    *   **Persistent Bug:** Throughout these changes, a syntax error (`return const event = ...;`) was present in the `dispatchFastForwardEvent` and `dispatchRewindEvent` functions, preventing these custom events from actually being dispatched.

3.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\keycodes.js` (Timestamp: 11:54:49)**
    *   A new file introduced to define a centralized set of key codes for HbbTV, using `window.KeyEvent` with fallback values for various actions (navigation, color buttons, playback controls, numeric keys). This standardizes key code definitions for the HbbTV platform.

4.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\hbbtv.js` (Timestamps: 11:55:42, 11:55:54, 11:56:04, 12:29:39, 12:33:41)**
    *   **Initial Implementation (11:55:42):** Introduced HbbTV-specific application initialization (`initAppHbbTV`) and keyboard navigation (`IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartHbbTV`). This includes registering a comprehensive set of remote keys via `app.privateData.keyset`, handling navigation and color keys, and mapping playback controls to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` actions.
    *   **Refactoring Player Actions (12:29:39):** Similar to `generic.js`, standardized player control calls (Play, Pause, Stop, Rewind, Fast Forward) from `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` to maintain consistency.
    *   **Bug Fix and Refactor (12:33:41):** Corrected the syntax error in `dispatchFastForwardEvent` and `dispatchRewindEvent` functions, ensuring that `customSeekKeyDown` events are correctly dispatched. These functions were also moved to a higher scope for better organization.

5.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\contexts\didomiContext.jsx` (Timestamps: 12:20:04, 12:20:41, 12:21:34)**
    *   **Initial Integration (12:20:04):** Introduced a React context (`DidomiContext`) to manage Didomi (consent management platform) integration. This includes state and references for managing the visibility of the consent notice and preferences, handling user interaction (especially the Back key), and integrating Didomi SDK lifecycle events. It renders an `ExitAppModal`.
    *   **Component Addition (12:21:34):** Added the `<ExtraAppModals/>` component to be rendered within the `DidomiContext.Provider`, indicating an expansion of modal management.

6.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (Timestamp: 12:29:46)**
    *   A new, extensive file dedicated to Tizen platform integration. This includes:
        *   Retrieving Tizen device information.
        *   Application lifecycle management (handling visibility changes, exiting the app).
        *   Monitoring network state changes and displaying a "NO_CONNECTION" modal if disconnected.
        *   Helpers for checking and debugging `webapis.appcommon`.
        *   Screen saver management (enabling/disabling).
        *   Registering a wide range of extra Samsung TV remote keys (media controls, color buttons, numeric, channel up/down).
        *   Functions to launch other Tizen applications and open the Samsung App Store.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Platform-Specific Modularization:** A strong pattern of organizing code into platform-specific files (`generic.js`, `hbbtv/hbbtv.js`, `tizen/tizen.js`) to handle diverse Smart TV environments.
*   **Keyboard Navigation Focus:** Keyboard input handling is a central theme, with dedicated functions to process key presses, prevent throttling, dispatch custom events, and map keys to application logic across all platform files.
*   **`window.AppGlobal` Usage:** The global `window.AppGlobal` object is consistently used to store and access application-wide state, player controls, key memory, and action handlers.
*   **Player Action Standardization:** There's an observable pattern of transitioning player control calls from `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` across different platform implementations, suggesting an effort towards a more standardized API for player interaction.
*   **Back Key Behavior:** Consistent handling of the "Back" key (various key codes like 8, 88, 461, 10009) to manage navigation history, exit modals, and interaction with consent pop-ups (`window.displayingDidomi`).
*   **Custom Event Dispatching:** The application heavily relies on `CustomEvent` to signal internal state changes, such as `customKeyDown`, `customNavigation`, and `customSeekKeyDown`.
*   **Consent Management:** The integration of Didomi highlights a focus on user privacy and consent, with UI elements and keyboard navigation tailored for consent flows.
*   **Debugging and Logging:** Frequent use of `ajsrConsole.log` and `console.log` indicates a strong emphasis on debugging and tracing application flow across different platforms.
*   **Incremental Refinement:** The repeated timestamps for `generic.js` and `hbbtv.js` show an iterative development process, with minor adjustments and bug fixes (like the `return const` error correction in `hbbtv.js`) being committed.
