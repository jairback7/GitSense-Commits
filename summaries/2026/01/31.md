# Activity Summary for 31/1/2026

## 1:03:12
The provided log details a series of code changes, primarily focusing on keyboard navigation, platform-specific integrations, and user consent management for a Smart TV application. All recorded changes occurred on January 30, 2026, indicating a focused development session.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\styles.scss` (Timestamp: 30/1/2026, 9:04:15)**
    *   This file defines the base styling for the main application page (`.page_view`) and a bottom gradient element (`.bottom-gradient`).
    *   The `.page_view` is configured with a fixed resolution (1920x1080px), absolute positioning, and a background image (`3cat_red-bg_1920x270.png`). It also includes styling for a `.rankingText` element.
    *   The `.bottom-gradient` is a fixed overlay at the bottom of the screen with a mask image (`mask_1080.png`).
    *   This entry appears to be an initial or static definition of these core UI styles.

2.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (Multiple timestamps)**
    *   **Initial state (30/1/2026, 11:38:08 & 11:38:42):** Introduces `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartTV` to handle keyboard input common to most Smart TV platforms, as well as specific handling for WebOS and Tizen. It defines `window.AppGlobal.KeyMemory` for processing key combinations (e.g., specific sequences for enabling/disabling ads). Player controls (Play, Pause, Stop, Rewind, Fast Forward) initially call methods from `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller`. The `dispatchFastForwardEvent` and `dispatchRewindEvent` functions had a syntax error (`return const event`).
    *   **WebOS Player Control Update (30/1/2026, 11:53:37):** A `VK_PLAY_PAUSE` key handler was added for WebOS, calling `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.togglePlayPause()`. This marks the first instance of using the `Actions` object for player control in this file.
    *   **Player API Refactoring (30/1/2026, 12:29:17 & 12:29:26):** Player control calls for WebOS (`Play`, `Pause`, `Stop`) were refactored from `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions`. For Tizen, the `Play` action was also moved to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.play()`, but `Pause` and `Stop` continued to use `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller.pause()`.

3.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\keycodes.js` (Timestamp: 30/1/2026, 11:54:49)**
    *   This file was introduced to define `KeyCodes` specific to the HbbTV platform. It uses `window.KeyEvent?.VK_KEY ?? fallback_value` for robustness, providing default key codes if `window.KeyEvent` is not available. This includes directional keys, colored buttons (RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE), and various player controls.

4.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\hbbtv.js` (Multiple timestamps)**
    *   **Initial state (30/1/2026, 11:55:42, 11:55:54 & 11:56:04):** Implemented `initAppHbbTV` for HbbTV application initialization, including an `evExitApplication` listener. The `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartHbbTV` function handles HbbTV-specific key presses, registering them via `app.privateData.keyset`. Player controls (`VK_PLAY`, `VK_PAUSE`, `VK_STOP`, `VK_REWIND`, `VK_FAST_FWD`) initially used `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` methods (e.g., `seekMinus10Seconds`), while `VK_PLAY_PAUSE` used `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.togglePlayPause()`.
    *   **Player API Refactoring (30/1/2026, 12:29:39):** All explicit player control calls (`play`, `pause`, `stop`, `seekMinus10Seconds`, `seekPlus10Seconds`) were refactored to use `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` methods instead of `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller`.
    *   **Seek Event Dispatching (30/1/2026, 12:33:41):** The `VK_REWIND` and `VK_FAST_FWD` key handlers were updated to dispatch `customSeekKeyDown` events via newly defined local `dispatchRewindEvent` and `dispatchFastForwardEvent` functions, rather than directly calling `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.seek...`. This aligns the HbbTV platform's seek event handling with the pattern seen in `generic.js`.

5.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\contexts\didomiContext.jsx` (Multiple timestamps)**
    *   **Initial state (30/1/2026, 12:20:04 & 12:20:41):** Introduced `DidomiContext` and `DidomiProvider` to manage user consent (Didomi SDK) and an exit application modal. It tracks the visibility of the Didomi notice and preferences, handles specific key presses (Back/Exit) to interact with the consent UI, and conditionally renders `children` when the Didomi notice is not displayed. The `ExtraAppModals` component was imported but not rendered.
    *   **Rendering `ExtraAppModals` (30/1/2026, 12:21:34):** The `ExtraAppModals` component was added to the rendered output of the `DidomiProvider`, appearing unconditionally.

6.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (Timestamp: 30/1/2026, 12:29:46)**
    *   This file defines comprehensive Tizen platform integration. It initializes the Tizen app, manages device information, and sets up listeners for `visibilitychange` (pausing/playing media and exiting the app as needed) and `evExitApplication`.
    *   It includes a `initNetworkStateListener` to detect network disconnections and display a "NO\_CONNECTION" modal.
    *   Functions for screen saver management (`initScreenSaverHelpers`), registration of extra Samsung TV remote keys (`initExtraSamsungKeys`), and launching other Tizen applications or the Samsung Store (`launchAppTizen`, `openSamsungStore`) are also defined. Player control calls consistently use `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Platform Abstraction and Specialization:** The code base shows a clear pattern of abstracting common functionalities (like keyboard navigation) while providing specialized implementations for different Smart TV platforms (WebOS, Tizen, HbbTV) and a generic fallback.
*   **`window.AppGlobal` Usage:** A central `window.AppGlobal` object is used extensively to store global application state, player controls, key combination logic (`KeyMemory`), and various actions (`Actions`).
*   **Player API Refactoring:** A significant recurring change across `generic.js` and `hbbtv.js` is the migration of player control methods from a `Controller` object to an `Actions` object within `window.AppGlobal.Player`. This suggests a refactoring effort to standardize and simplify player interactions.
*   **Keyboard Event Handling:** All platform-specific files include detailed `keydown` event listeners with key throttling, custom event dispatching (`customKeyDown`, `customNavigation`, `customSeekKeyDown`), and complex `switch` statements to map physical key codes to application actions.
*   **Exit Application Logic:** There's a consistent pattern for handling application exit, often triggered by a custom `evExitApplication` event and involving `goBackHistory` alongside platform-specific methods to terminate the application.
*   **Didomi Consent Integration:** A dedicated React Context (`didomiContext.jsx`) is used for managing user consent, indicating a focus on GDPR compliance or similar regulatory requirements, with specific UI and key handling logic.
*   **Consistent Logging:** The use of `ajsrConsole.log` (or `console.log`) throughout the platform files suggests a verbose logging strategy for debugging and tracking execution flow.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** All changes occurring on the same date within a few hours (between 9 AM and 1 PM) point to a concentrated development or debugging session, possibly addressing multiple issues or implementing a new feature in a short timeframe.

The provided log details a series of code changes, primarily focused on keyboard navigation and platform-specific functionalities for a Smart TV application. All changes occurred on **30/1/2026**.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\styles.scss` (30/1/2026, 9:04:15)**:
    *   This file defines the styling for the `.page_view` and `.bottom-gradient` elements.
    *   `.page_view` is styled with a `3cat_red-bg_1920x270.png` background, positioned absolutely, and has a fixed width/height (1920x1080px). It also includes styling for `.rankingText` (absolute position, italic font, specific color).
    *   `.bottom-gradient` is fixed at the bottom with a `mask_1080.png` background.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (Multiple timestamps: 11:38:08, 11:38:42, 11:53:37, 12:29:17, 12:29:26)**:
    *   This file manages generic keyboard navigation for Smart TV platforms.
    *   **Initial Setup (11:38:08)**: Imports `goBackHistory` and `KeyCodes`. It initializes `window.AppGlobal.KeyMemory` to track key combinations and defines `window.AppGlobal.keyCombinations` for specific actions like enabling/disabling ads based on key sequences (e.g., "979899" for ads on, "999897" for ads off). The `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartTV` function sets up a throttled `onKeyDownHandler` to process common Smart TV keys (navigation, ENTER, BACK, numeric) and dispatches custom events. Player-related keys are handled, with different implementations for WebOS, Tizen, and other platforms.
    *   **Minor Save (11:38:42)**: No functional code changes observed compared to the previous entry.
    *   **WebOS Player Key Update (11:53:37)**: A new case `window.KeyEvent?.VK_PLAY_PAUSE || 0x52` was added to the WebOS-specific key handling to call `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.togglePlayPause()`. This introduced a slight inconsistency as other WebOS player controls still used `Player.Controller`.
    *   **Refactor: WebOS Player Actions (12:29:17)**: The `play`, `pause`, and `stop` actions for WebOS were refactored to use `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` instead of `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller`, standardizing the API calls for player control within WebOS.
    *   **Refactor: Tizen Player Actions (12:29:26)**: Similarly, the `play`, `pause`, and `stop` actions for Tizen were updated to use `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` instead of `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller`, enhancing consistency across platforms.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\keycodes.js` (30/1/2026, 11:54:49)**:
    *   This new file defines a `KeyCodes` object specific to HbbTV. It maps common Smart TV keys (navigation, colored buttons, media controls, numeric) to their HbbTV `window.KeyEvent` values, providing numeric fallbacks if `window.KeyEvent` is unavailable.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\hbbtv.js` (Multiple timestamps: 11:55:42, 11:55:54, 11:56:04, 12:29:39, 12:33:41)**:
    *   This file provides HbbTV-specific application and keyboard navigation logic.
    *   **Initial Implementation (11:55:42)**: Imports `KeyCodes` and `goBackHistory`. `initAppHbbTV` sets up device logging and an `evExitApplication` listener. `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartHbbTV` registers necessary keys with the HbbTV application's keyset mask (navigation, VCR, colored buttons) and defines a `processKey` function to handle these. Media controls (Play, Pause, Stop, Rewind, Fast Forward) initially used `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` methods for seeking.
    *   **Minor Saves (11:55:54, 11:56:04)**: No functional code changes were introduced in these saves, primarily related to destructuring `KeyCodes` further for `VK_PLAY_PAUSE`.
    *   **Refactor: HbbTV Player Actions (12:29:39)**: All player control actions (`play`, `pause`, `stop`, `seekMinus10Seconds`, `seekPlus10Seconds`) were updated from using `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` methods to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` methods, aligning with changes in `generic.js`.
    *   **Refactor: HbbTV Seek Events (12:33:41)**: Introduced `dispatchFastForwardEvent` and `dispatchRewindEvent` helper functions. The `VK_REWIND` and `VK_FAST_FWD` cases in the `processKey` function were updated to call these new dispatch functions, standardizing how seek events are triggered.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\contexts\didomiContext.jsx` (Multiple timestamps: 12:20:04, 12:20:41, 12:21:34)**:
    *   This file implements a React Context for Didomi, a consent management platform.
    *   **Initial Implementation (12:20:04)**: Defines `DidomiContext` and `DidomiProvider`. It manages the visibility of the Didomi notice and preferences, handling keydown events (especially the `BACK` key) to navigate consent modals or close them. It registers various listeners for Didomi SDK events (`notice.hidden`, `preferences.shown`, `preferences.hidden`, click events) and conditionally renders application children or an `ExitAppModal` based on consent visibility.
    *   **Minor Save (12:20:41)**: No functional code changes observed.
    *   **Modal Inclusion (12:21:34)**: The `ExtraAppModals` component was added to be rendered within the `DidomiContext.Provider`, indicating the integration of additional application-specific modals.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (30/1/2026, 12:29:46)**:
    *   This file provides Tizen-specific platform functionalities.
    *   It includes functions to fetch Tizen device information, initialize the app, and handle application lifecycle events (`visibilitychange` for pausing/resuming playback).
    *   It implements a network state listener to detect disconnections and display a "NO_CONNECTION" modal.
    *   The file manages screen saver functionality (`enableScreenSaver`, `disableScreenSaver`) using Tizen's `webapis.appcommon`.
    *   `initExtraSamsungKeys` registers a comprehensive list of extra Samsung TV remote keys (media, color, numeric, channel) for the application.
    *   Functions `launchAppTizen` and `openSamsungStore` are provided for interacting with other applications or the Samsung app store.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Cross-Platform Keyboard Navigation:** A significant effort is dedicated to handling keyboard input across generic Smart TV, WebOS, Tizen, and HbbTV platforms. This includes key code mapping, event throttling, and dispatching custom navigation and media control events.
*   **Player API Standardization:** A clear pattern of refactoring emerged where `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` method calls were consistently migrated to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` across `generic.js`, `hbbtv.js`, and `tizen.js`. This indicates a move towards a unified or preferred API for player interactions.
*   **Consent Management Integration (Didomi):** The `DidomiContext` demonstrates a comprehensive integration of a consent management platform, handling UI toggling, event listeners, and interaction with app navigation (e.g., `BACK` key).
*   **Platform-Specific Device Interaction:** Each platform file (`generic.js`, `hbbtv.js`, `tizen.js`) shows code tailored to its environment for tasks like device information retrieval, app lifecycle management, and specific API calls (e.g., `app.privateData.keyset` for HbbTV, `tizen.tvinputdevice.registerKey` for Tizen, `webapis.network` for Tizen).
*   **Ad Control:** Direct key combinations are provided in `generic.js` to enable or disable ads, suggesting in-app debugging or testing capabilities for ad integration.
*   **Extensive Logging:** Frequent use of `ajsrConsole.log` and `console.log` throughout the files indicates a strong emphasis on debugging and tracing application flow, especially for platform-specific behaviors and key presses.
*   **Custom Event Dispatching:** The application leverages `CustomEvent` for various interactions (e.g., `customKeyDown`, `customNavigation`, `customSeekKeyDown`), promoting a decoupled and event-driven architecture.
