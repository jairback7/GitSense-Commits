# Activity Summary for 16/1/2026

## 9:37:11
The provided log details changes across two main types of files: a Node.js packaging script (`package-launcher-apps.cjs`) and React component files (`index.jsx`, `styles.scss`). All recorded changes occurred on the same day, **14/1/2026**, indicating a focused development period.

### File-Specific Updates:

**1. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\package-launcher-apps.cjs`**

This Node.js script is responsible for packaging applications for WebOS and Tizen platforms across different environments (DEV, PRE, PRO). The changes reflect a continuous evolution of its packaging capabilities:

*   **14/1/2026, 12:28:33 (Initial state):** The script was an established tool with core functionalities: parsing CLI arguments, managing directories (creation, copy, removal), reading app metadata from `package.json`, and packaging for WebOS (using `ares-package`) and Tizen (using `tizen package` with a temporary directory). Generated packages were renamed to a standardized format.
*   **14/1/2026, 12:31:38:**
    *   Introduced multi-resolution packaging for **WebOS**. The script began generating separate `.ipk` packages for `720p` and `1080p` resolutions, modifying `appinfo.json` within temporary directories for each resolution by setting `screenWidth` and `screenHeight`.
    *   For **Tizen PRO** builds, it initially added an interactive prompt using `readlineSync` to ask for a certificate/profile name for signing.
*   **14/1/2026, 12:36:07:** Minor cosmetic change to a comment for `readlineSync` and continued the development of WebOS multi-resolution packaging, ensuring success messages for each generated package.
*   **14/1/2026, 12:39:35:** Removed the `readlineSync` dependency and the custom certificate prompt for Tizen PRO. The script reverted to relying on the Tizen CLI's native prompting mechanism for certificates, if multiple exist. The `--sign` option was removed from the `tizen package` command.
*   **14/1/2026, 12:40:47:** A non-functional change, likely a re-save or minor formatting adjustment.
*   **14/1/2026, 12:48:19:** Modified the **WebOS** `appinfo.json` update logic. Instead of `screenWidth` and `screenHeight`, it now sets `appinfo.resolution = "WIDTHxHEIGHT"` and added a debug log for this change.
*   **14/1/2026, 12:54:31:** Significant refactoring of the **WebOS** packaging flow. Packaging for all resolutions now occurs first, followed by a separate post-processing step to detect and rename each generated `.ipk` file. The `appinfo.json` for WebOS was also updated to include `appinfo.version = pkgVersion`.
*   **14/1/2026, 12:56:18 to 13:03:53:** Several non-functional changes, likely re-saves or minor formatting tweaks without affecting the script's logic.
*   **14/1/2026, 13:13:19 to 13:20:38:**
    *   Re-introduced an interactive prompt for **Tizen PRO** certificate selection, this time using the standard `readline` module instead of `readlineSync`.
    *   A new function `chooseTizenProfile` was added to list available profiles from `tizen security-profiles list` and prompt the user for selection.
    *   The Tizen packaging logic was wrapped in a `runPackage` function, which is called after a profile is chosen (if PRO environment) to include the `--sign` option. These entries show the Tizen PRO block in an incomplete state, suggesting active development or partial log capture.
*   **14/1/2026, 13:51:14:** Added logic to update the `version` attribute within the `config.xml` file for **Tizen** packages, ensuring consistency with the project's `package.json`.
*   **14/1/2026, 13:56:41:** Refined the regex used to update the `version` in **Tizen's `config.xml`** to be more specific, targeting the `version` attribute within the `<widget>` tag.
*   **14/1/2026, 14:02:48:** Added an extra `if (fs.existsSync(...)) fs.rmdirSync(...)` call for robustness after `removeDirRecursive` in the **WebOS** packaging loop.

**2. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx`**

*   **14/1/2026, 14:17:53 (Initial state):** This React component (`InfoGroup`) was implemented to display detailed media information in a smart TV application. It integrates various sub-components for tags, titles, age ratings, durations, and features. It handles logic for different media types (live, upcoming events) and dynamically fetches data like logos and descriptions. A notable comment (`// JIRA CCMA-2104: Eliminamos funcionalidad 'A partir del'`) indicates a previous decision to remove a "Publication" date display.
*   **14/1/2026, 16:02:00:** A non-functional change, the code content is identical to the previous timestamp, likely a re-save.

**3. `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\styles.scss`**

*   **14/1/2026, 16:13:54 (Initial state):** This SCSS file defines the styling for a generic row component, including its title, and various row types (HERO, BANNER, LANDSCAPE, etc.). It also styles a "show all" item with focus and hover effects using `$base-color-3cat-red`. Debugging styles are commented out.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Iterative Development:** The `package-launcher-apps.cjs` file shows a clear pattern of iterative development. Features like WebOS multi-resolution support and Tizen certificate handling were introduced, refined, and even changed implementation strategies (e.g., `readlineSync` to Tizen CLI's native prompt, then to `readline`).
*   **Platform-Specific Logic:** The packaging script dedicates distinct code blocks for WebOS and Tizen, addressing their unique packaging commands and metadata structures (`appinfo.json` for WebOS, `config.xml` for Tizen).
*   **Temporary Directories and Cleanup:** A recurring pattern in the packaging script is the use of temporary directories (`tmp_webos_...`, `tmp_tizen_...`) to prepare source files (e.g., modifying `appinfo.json` or `config.xml`) before calling platform-specific CLI tools, followed by recursive removal of these temporary directories to maintain a clean workspace.
*   **Metadata Synchronization:** Efforts were made to synchronize application version and resolution metadata from `package.json` into platform-specific configuration files (`appinfo.json` for WebOS, `config.xml` for Tizen).
*   **Debugging and Robustness:** The addition of `DEBUG` logs and redundant `fs.rmdirSync` calls (after `removeDirRecursive`) indicates an emphasis on debugging and ensuring robust directory cleanup.
*   **UI Component Stability:** The React component files (`index.jsx` and `styles.scss`) appear to be relatively stable during this logging period, with only one functional entry per file and subsequent non-functional re-saves. The `index.jsx` file suggests previous work related to Jira tickets.
*   **Incomplete Code Snippets:** Multiple entries for `package-launcher-apps.cjs` show incomplete code at the end of the log, particularly for the Tizen PRO environment block. This suggests the logs were captured during active coding sessions where files were saved in an unfinished state.
