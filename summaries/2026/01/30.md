# Activity Summary for 30/1/2026

## 0:50:34
The log captures a series of code changes primarily focused on platform-specific adaptations, routing enhancements, and build process refinements for a SmartTV application, likely named "3cat_smarttv". The changes span two days, January 28th and 29th, 2026.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\exitAppModal\styles.kids.scss` (28/1/2026, 11:21:03):** Initial or updated styling was applied for an exit application modal when in "kid-mode". This included setting background color to a vibrant purple, padding, title font size, and button styles with a white border and a distinct vibrant-purple box-shadow on focus.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (28/1/2026, 11:25:02 and 29/1/2026, 10:22:40):** The `ExtraAppModals` component was introduced to the main application for managing additional modals. A day later, the `InitDevConsole()` call was uncommented in a `useEffect` hook, enabling the development console during application startup.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\collectionItems\landscapeItem\index.jsx` (28/1/2026, 13:05:28 and 13:05:51):** The `LandscapeItem` UI was refined by adding a bottom-to-top gradient (`bg-bottom-top-gradient`) and wrapping the item's title within an `infoContainer` for better styling control.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\styles.scss` (28/1/2026, 13:06:46, 14:36:24, 14:52:00, 14:59:35):** This SCSS file underwent multiple minor adjustments. Initially, it defined comprehensive styling for various row types and their content, including detailed focus/hover effects. A small change in `line-height` for `.row-title` occurred, followed by commenting out specific `width` and `height` properties for `.item-show-all.LANDSCAPE`, suggesting a move towards more generalized styling or dynamic sizing.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\router\navigationRoute.js` (28/1/2026, 13:13:07, 13:13:44, 14:32:50, 14:33:53):** The `getNavigationRoute` function was iteratively improved. First, a previously commented-out section for detailed `link` data handling was uncommented, allowing for richer routing based on linked content metadata. Subsequently, a new `user_row` collection type was added to the routing logic, and then consolidated with `menu_link` into a single conditional block for conciseness.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\landscapeItem\styles.scss` (28/1/2026, 15:03:25):** Detailed styling for `landscapeItem` within rows was introduced, defining layouts for tags (including a "live" tag), gradients, platform-specific footers, and different title styles, along with distinct focus/hover effects using red accents.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\components\audioAndSubsMenu\index.jsx` (28/1/2026, 15:55:39):** Kid-mode specific styles (`styles.kids.scss`) were integrated, and minor focus management improvements were made to the audio and subtitle options using `data-block-focus` attributes.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\utils\platformUtils.js` (28/1/2026, 18:18:55 and 29/1/2026, 15:22:21):** The direct injection of `webOSTV.js` library within the `getPlatform` function was first commented out and later entirely removed. This indicates a shift to handling platform-specific script loading at the build configuration level (e.g., via Vite).
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\package.json` (28/1/2026, 18:29:40, 18:29:48, 29/1/2026, 10:18:45, 14:09:03, 14:12:50):** The project's `package.json` saw substantial restructuring. Initially, `preview:sm` was renamed to `preview:smarttv`. On the second day, entire sections for "Base Device Builds" and "SmartTV Builds" were removed, consolidating the build process around "Hosted Webapps" for `smarttv` and `hbbtv`. New `start` scripts combining build and preview steps were added, and deployment scripts were enhanced with "all" commands for streamlined multi-environment deployment.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\3cat_pro\gateway\js\app.js` (multiple timestamps on 28th and 29th):** These files (and similar ones in `build_templates`) concern WebOS gateway application logic. They frequently updated the target `REMOTE` URL for the main application, switching between local development IPs (`http://192.168.1.138:4173/`) and production/preproduction domains (`https://smartv-pro.3cat.website/`). There were also changes in including specific query parameters like `?pr=true` (for parental rating, likely) or `?qr=true` in the redirection URL.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html` (29/1/2026, 10:25:23 and 13:57:28):** Direct script inclusions for webOS and Tizen APIs were removed, and a `purple-console.min.js` script was commented out, then re-enabled. A new placeholder `<!-- [[[ inject platform ]]] -->` was added, indicating a move towards dynamic, build-time platform-specific script injection.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (29/1/2026, 10:37:09, 10:37:16, 10:38:09, 10:44:50, 10:51:24):** This core page component saw iterative changes in error logging and debugging. A minor correction in an error variable name was made, followed by adding and then reverting more verbose `ajsrConsole.log` statements for data fetching errors. Finally, a debug log was added to track the `location` object in a `useEffect` hook.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\tizen\3cat_dev\gateway\js\app.js`, `3cat_pre\gateway\js\app.js`, `3cat_pro\gateway\js\app.js` (29/1/2026, ~10:59):** These gateway scripts for Tizen environments consistently configure `REMOTE` URLs for dev, pre-production, and production, check network connectivity, and handle `VK_BACK`/`VK_EXIT` key events for application exit.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\webos\3cat_dev\gateway\js\app.js`, `3cat_pre\gateway\js\app.js`, `3cat_pro\gateway\js\app.js` (multiple timestamps on 29th):** These WebOS gateway scripts were updated to consistently use `?pr=true` in the `REMOTE` URL, and later, the explicit `index.html` was removed from the URLs, standardizing the path.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\vite.config.js` (multiple timestamps on 29th):** This configuration file underwent extensive changes, reflecting a significant overhaul of the build system.
    *   It manages versioning (updating `.env` file).
    *   It configured legacy browser support (`chrome: "38"`) with specific polyfills.
    *   The HTML injection plugin was refactored multiple times to dynamically inject platform-specific meta tags and scripts (`webOSTV.js`, `$WEBAPIS/webapis/webapis.js`) based on platform detection (User-Agent or `window` properties) directly into `index.html`. This move consolidates runtime script loading and removes the need for separate build processes for WebOS/Tizen.
    *   Removed `__SUPPORTED_DEVICES__` define, indicating a shift away from passing this config via `process.env`.
    *   Platform-specific output directories were adjusted.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Platform Abstraction & Dynamic Loading:** A strong pattern emerges around abstracting platform-specific logic and dynamically loading necessary libraries. This is evident in `platformUtils.js`, `index.html`, and `vite.config.js` working together to detect the platform (WebOS, Tizen, HbbTV) and inject the appropriate SDK scripts at runtime or build time.
2.  **Kid Mode Integration:** The repeated appearance of `styles.kids.scss` and `UserType.KID` in `App.jsx` and `Page.jsx` indicates a dedicated "kid-mode" feature with its own styling and content filtering.
3.  **Build System Refinement (Vite):** `vite.config.js` and `package.json` show continuous iteration on the build and deployment pipeline. The shift from "Base Device Builds" to "Hosted Webapp Builds" and dynamic script injection suggests a strategy to create more flexible and maintainable builds for various SmartTV environments.
4.  **Gateway Redirection Logic:** The `gateway/js/app.js` files consistently implement logic to check network connectivity, determine the correct `REMOTE` URL for the main application (often including specific query parameters like `?pr=true`), and redirect, ensuring the application loads correctly based on the environment and SDK version.
5.  **Debugging & Logging:** The frequent addition/removal of `ajsrConsole.log` statements in `App.jsx` and `Page.jsx` points to an active development cycle with a focus on debugging application flow and data fetching.
6.  **UI/UX Refinements:** Minor adjustments to SCSS files (`genericRow`, `landscapeItem`, `exitAppModal`) demonstrate ongoing visual and layout polishing.
7.  **Error Handling:** Updates to `Page.jsx` reflect an effort to refine error reporting and user feedback during data loading.

## 1:50:00
The provided log details code changes primarily within a SmartTV application project. The changes span styling, component logic, routing, platform utility functions, build configurations, and HTML templating, all occurring on January 28th and 29th, 2026.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\exitAppModal\styles.kids.scss`** (28/1/2026, 11:21:03):
    *   Updated styling for the `exitAppModal` in kid mode.
    *   Changes include setting `background-color` to `$base-color-3cat-kid-vibrant-purple`, increasing `padding-top` and `padding-bottom` to 120px, and adjusting `font-size` for the title to 38px.
    *   Button styles were also modified, including `height` (54px), `border-radius` (60px), `font-size` (19px), `line-height` (56px), `margin-right` (32px), `width` (56px), `padding` (0 11px), and `border` (1px solid #ffffff).
    *   The `.focused` state for buttons now includes a `box-shadow` and `border-color` using `$base-color-3cat-kid-white`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx`** (28/1/2026, 11:25:02 and 29/1/2026, 10:22:40):
    *   **Initial Change (28/1):** Added an import for `DebugModalsLauncher` and `ExtraAppModals` components, indicating new debugging and modal functionalities. The `InitDevConsole` function, which configures a debug console, was commented out in `useEffect` and then re-enabled in a later commit. The `handleOk` function now explicitly checks `activeUser?.type === UserType.KID` when handling `ModalTypes.EXIT`, leading to different navigation logic for kid users (dispatching `evChangeUser`, exiting menu, navigating to `/usersScreen` or `/home`).
    *   **Later Change (29/1):** The `InitDevConsole()` call inside `AppInner`'s `useEffect` was uncommented, suggesting the debug console is now actively used on app load.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\collectionItems\landscapeItem\index.jsx`** (28/1/2026, 13:05:28 and 28/1/2026, 13:05:51):
    *   **Initial Change (28/1, 13:05:28):** No significant content changes visible in this specific diff block compared to a potential previous state (only provided the *after* state). It displays a `LandscapeItem` component structure with debug layers and image handling.
    *   **Later Change (28/1, 13:05:51):** The component was updated to include a `<div className='bg-bottom-top-gradient'/>` and wrap the title in `<div className='infoContainer'>` with a `bg-bottom-top-gradient` added. This indicates a visual enhancement for the item's information display.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\styles.scss`** (28/1/2026, 13:06:46, 28/1/2026, 14:36:24, 28/1/2026, 14:52:00, 28/1/2026, 14:59:35):
    *   **Multiple Changes (28/1):**
        *   The `line-height` for `.row-title` was updated from `29px` to `31px`.
        *   A comment `/*&.LANDSCAPE{ width: 390px; height: 220px; }*/` was added, indicating a previous explicit sizing for `LANDSCAPE` items that might have been removed or commented out.
        *   The code content remains largely identical across these timestamps after the initial `line-height` change and the addition of the commented block.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\router\navigationRoute.js`** (28/1/2026, 13:13:07, 28/1/2026, 13:13:44, 28/1/2026, 14:32:50, 28/1/2026, 14:33:53):
    *   **Multiple Changes (28/1):**
        *   **13:13:07 to 13:13:44:** Un-commented a block of logic within the `else` condition for routing when `contentType` is not `series` or `collection`, specifically handling `dataType === 'collection'` or `dataType === 'page' || dataType === 'row'`. This restores more detailed routing based on `link.data.type`.
        *   **14:32:50:** Added a new condition `else if (item.collection === 'user_row') { routeUrl = item.slug || item.page_data?.slug || item.static_page_data?.slug; }` to handle navigation for `user_row` collection types.
        *   **14:33:53:** Consolidated the `menu_link` and `user_row` routing into a single `else if (item.collection === 'menu_link' || item.collection === 'user_row')` block, streamlining the logic.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\landscapeItem\styles.scss`** (28/1/2026, 15:03:25):
    *   Added styles for a new `landscapeItem` component.
    *   Includes definitions for `margin-bottom`, `.external-content`, `.tag` (with `.live` specific styles), focused and hover states for the item, `bg-bottom-top-gradient`, `platform-footer`, `infoContainer`, and `.title` and `.series-title` with `ellipsis-two-lines` truncations.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\components\audioAndSubsMenu\index.jsx`** (28/1/2026, 15:55:39):
    *   Added import for `styles.kids.scss`, indicating specific kid-mode styling for the audio and subtitles menu.
    *   Modified the default label for audio/subtitle options in `getOptionList` from `item.label ? item.label : 'Català'` to simply `item.label ? item.label : 'Català'`, which is technically no change in this diff view but highlights the default.
    *   The `title` tags inside the `return` statement were changed from a standard `div` to actual `title` elements, which is syntactically incorrect in JSX and likely a bug or temporary change. The second title for "Subtítols" also has a class `sub`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\utils\platformUtils.js`** (28/1/2026, 18:18:55 and 29/1/2026, 15:22:21):
    *   **Initial Change (28/1):** Removed the code block responsible for injecting the `webOSTV.js` library directly into the document's head when the platform is `webos`. A comment explains that this was previously done in `vite.config.ts` (now `.js`) and that specific builds were removed from `package.json`. This implies a shift in how platform-specific scripts are loaded or managed.
    *   **Later Change (29/1):** The code remains the same as the prior timestamp, confirming the removal of direct `webOSTV.js` injection from this utility file.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\package.json`** (Multiple timestamps: 28/1/2026, 18:29:40 to 29/1/2026, 14:12:50):
    *   **Minor Fix (28/1, 18:29:48):** Corrected a typo in a preview script command from `preview:sm` to `preview:smarttv`.
    *   **Major Restructuring (29/1, 14:09:03):** The entire `scripts` section was significantly reorganized and simplified.
        *   Removed old sections like "BASE DEVICE BUILDS" and "SMARTTV BUILDS".
        *   Introduced a new "HOSTED WEBAPP BUILDS" section (`build:smarttv:hosted_webapp` and `build:hbbtv:hosted_webapp`) which explicitly sets `VITE_PLATFORM` environment variable and uses `--outDir dist/hosted_apps/` for different environments (dev, pre, prod).
        *   "PREVIEW (serve built dist)" was updated to "PREVIEW HOSTED WEBAPP" with corresponding paths.
        *   A new "START (preview + build)" section was added, combining build and preview commands for hosted webapps.
        *   Removed all "EMBEDDED APPS" sections (TODO comments were present before).
        *   Added `deploy:smarttv:all` and `deploy:hbbtv:all` scripts, and `deploy:hosted_webapp:all` to orchestrate full deployments.
        *   The structure now heavily favors hosted webapp builds over direct device builds.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html`** (29/1/2026, 10:25:23, 29/1/2026, 13:57:28, 29/1/2026, 14:26:07):
    *   **Initial Change (29/1, 10:25:23):** Removed commented `webOSTV.js` script tags, but kept one active. Added a script tag for `shaka.4.13.8.js` and `ima3.js`. Notably, the `purple-console.min.js` script import was commented out.
    *   **Later Changes (29/1, 13:57:28 & 14:26:07):**
        *   Removed `<script src="$WEBAPIS/webapis/webapis.js"></script>` and `<script src='libs/webOSTVjs-1.2.11/webOSTV.js'></script>` from the HTML directly.
        *   Introduced a new placeholder `<!-- [[[ inject platform ]]] -->`, suggesting platform-specific script injection is now handled dynamically by the build process (as seen in `vite.config.js`).
        *   Re-enabled `purple-console.min.js` temporarily in `index.html` (10:25:23) but then commented it out again (13:57:28), indicating testing or fluctuating requirements for its inclusion.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx`** (Multiple timestamps: 29/1/2026, 10:37:09 to 29/1/2026, 10:51:24):
    *   **Multiple Changes (29/1):**
        *   **10:37:16:** Corrected a `_error.message` reference to `error.message` within `refreshLives` catch block.
        *   **10:38:09:** Added `ajsrConsole.log("getHomeData " + err?.message);` to the `getHomeData` error handler, and similarly `ajsrConsole.log("getPageData " + err?.message);` to the `getPageData` error handler for improved debugging.
        *   **10:44:50:** The `ajsrConsole.log("getHomeData " + err?.message);` and `ajsrConsole.log("getPageData " + err?.message);` lines were reverted (removed), indicating debug logging was possibly temporary or moved elsewhere.
        *   **10:51:24:** Added `ajsrConsole.log("Error location: " + location);` at the beginning of a `useEffect` hook, again for debugging navigation issues.
        *   Consistently, the `filterChildren` function restricts certain content types (`slider` for unsupported live, `CANALS TEMÀTICS` for unsupported Shaka Player, external content for HbbTV, and `user_row` for kid users), demonstrating platform and user-type specific content filtering.

*   **Gateway `app.js` files (multiple paths for `tizen` and `webos` in `build_templates`, and the main `gateway` folder itself):** (Multiple timestamps: 28/1/2026, 18:31:53 to 29/1/2026, 14:35:30):
    *   These `app.js` files are gateway scripts responsible for checking internet connectivity and redirecting the TV to the main application URL.
    *   **Consistent Pattern:** They all contain similar logic:
        1.  Define `WEBOS_MANAGER` / `PALM_MANAGER` (for webOS) or use `webapis.network` (for Tizen).
        2.  Define a `REMOTE` URL, which is the actual SmartTV application's hosted URL (e.g., `https://smartv-pro.3cat.website/`).
        3.  Check `sdkVersion` (for webOS) or `platformVersion` (for Tizen) to potentially adjust the `REMOTE` URL or `connectionmanager`.
        4.  Attempt to get network status.
        5.  If connected, redirect to `REMOTE + query`.
        6.  If not connected, display an alert, set up keydown listeners (e.g., for back/exit), and subscribe to network state changes to redirect once connected.
    *   **Specific Changes:**
        *   **28/1, 18:31:53:** `REMOTE` for `3cat_pro\gateway\js\app.js` was set to `http://192.168.1.138:4173/`, a local development server URL.
        *   **28/1, 18:52:08:** `REMOTE` for `3cat_pro\gateway\js\app.js` was reverted to `https://smartv-pro.3cat.website/index.html`.
        *   **29/1, 10:59:54 to 11:07:09:** The `REMOTE` URL for `webos` gateway templates (`3cat_dev`, `3cat_pre`, `3cat_pro`) was changed to include `?pr=true` in the query string or directly in the URL for older SDK versions (e.g., `https://smartv-dev.3cat.website/?pr=true`). Then, `index.html` was removed from the URL for older SDK versions.
        *   **29/1, 11:07:59:** The query string `query` for the `3cat_pro` webOS gateway was changed from `?pr=true` to `?qr=true`.
        *   **29/1, 11:09:54:** The query string `query` for the `3cat_pro` webOS gateway was changed back to `?pr=true`.
        *   **29/1, 14:35:30:** `REMOTE` for `3cat_pro\gateway\js\app.js` was set back to the local `http://192.168.1.138:4173/` again, indicating local testing.
        *   Tizen gateway templates (`3cat_dev`, `3cat_pre`, `3cat_pro`) consistently use `https://smartv-{env}.3cat.website/` as `REMOTE` and don't involve the `?pr=true` or `?qr=true` query strings.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\vite.config.js`** (Multiple timestamps: 29/1/2026, 13:36:21 to 29/1/2026, 14:53:21):
    *   **Consistent Pattern:** All versions of `vite.config.js` include a self-executing function to update `.env` file with `VITE_APP_VERSION`, `VITE_BUILD_NUMBER`, and `VITE_BUILD_DATE` from `package.json`.
    *   They define `_base_plugins` with `react()` and `@vitejs/plugin-legacy` for compatibility with older browsers (Chrome 38, IE 11+ with polyfills).
    *   They include `html-transform`, `remove-html-comments`, and `remove-empty-lines` plugins.
    *   **Significant Changes:**
        *   **29/1, 13:39:15:** Added `SUPPORTED_DEVICES` constant, but it's not immediately used in this version's `_plugin_html_inject`.
        *   **29/1, 13:40:14:** Added `__SUPPORTED_DEVICES__: JSON.stringify(...)` to the `define` object in the Vite configuration, which would make the `SUPPORTED_DEVICES` object available globally within the app, filtered by platform.
        *   **29/1, 13:51:00:** The `_plugin_html_inject` was significantly rewritten. It no longer conditionally injects `<script>` tags for `webos` or `tizen` directly into the HTML using comments. Instead, it centralizes injection logic into a `switch (platform)` statement. Comments within this file explicitly state that `webOSTV.js` injection is now handled in `platformUtils.js` and `tizen` specific assets were commented out, implying a shift in strategy.
        *   **29/1, 13:57:14:** Reverted the `_plugin_html_inject` back to a more simplified structure, introducing `<!-- [[[ inject platform ]]] -->` placeholder and injecting a `<script>` block that dynamically detects `webOS` or `Tizen` from the user agent and injects the corresponding platform script (`webOSTVjs-1.2.11/webOSTV.js` or `$WEBAPIS/webapis/webapis.js`) at runtime, if needed. This represents a major change towards dynamic platform script loading for SmartTVs.
        *   **29/1, 14:29:17 to 14:42:48:** Minor refinements in the dynamic script injection logic within `_plugin_html_inject`, specifically adjusting the `if` condition for `web0s` detection to `/web0s/.test(ua)` instead of `window.WebAppRuntime || /web0s/.test(ua)`. It also adjusted the Tizen detection from `window.tizen` to `window.tizen || /tizen/.test(ua)`.
        *   **29/1, 14:53:21:** The `_plugin_html_inject` was renamed to `inject-platform-specific-assets` and comments indicating test forcing of platform were removed.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Date Specificity:** All changes occurred on January 28th and 29th, 2026, suggesting a focused two-day development effort.
*   **Platform Adaptability:** A dominant theme is the adaptation of the application for different SmartTV platforms (webOS, Tizen, HbbTV) and various environments (development, preproduction, production). This is evident in:
    *   The `App.jsx` handling of `isHbbTV` for navigation.
    *   The `page/index.jsx` filtering content based on `isLiveSupported`, `isShakaPlayerSupported`, `AppGlobal.platform === 'hbbtv'`, and `UserType.KID`.
    *   The gateway `app.js` scripts redirecting to platform-specific hosted URLs and handling platform-specific network checks and key codes.
    *   The `vite.config.js` dynamically injecting platform-specific scripts and meta tags into `index.html`.
*   **Kid Mode / Parental Control:** Several files (`styles.kids.scss`, `App.jsx`, `page/index.jsx`) contain logic and styling specifically for "kid mode" or "child mode," indicating a parental control or kid-friendly feature is being developed or refined.
*   **Debugging and Logging:** Frequent additions and removals of `ajsrConsole.log` statements in JavaScript files (`App.jsx`, `page/index.jsx`, `platformUtils.js`) suggest active debugging and troubleshooting during this period. The `InitDevConsole` function also points to a custom debug console setup.
*   **Build Process Refinement:** The `package.json` and `vite.config.js` changes show a significant overhaul of the build and deployment pipeline, shifting towards a hosted webapp model and consolidating build commands for different platforms and environments. The removal of direct script injections from `index.html` and their migration to `vite.config.js` for dynamic injection or `platformUtils.js` demonstrates an effort to streamline and centralize platform-specific concerns.
*   **Styling Consistency:** The use of `@import '@/colors.scss'` or `@import "../../../colors.scss";` across SCSS files ensures a consistent color palette.
*   **Modular Component Development:** The changes occur within specific components (`exitAppModal`, `landscapeItem`, `genericRow`, `audioAndSubsMenu`, `Page`), indicating a modular approach to UI and feature development.
*   **Error Handling:** Repeated patterns of checking `err?.message?.includes('Unauthorized')` or `Token expired'` in API calls (`page/index.jsx`) suggest robust error handling related to user authentication.
