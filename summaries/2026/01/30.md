## 0:50:34
The log captures a series of code changes primarily focused on platform-specific adaptations, routing enhancements, and build process refinements for a SmartTV application, likely named "3cat_smarttv". The changes span two days, January 28th and 29th, 2026.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\exitAppModal\styles.kids.scss` (28/1/2026, 11:21:03):** Initial or updated styling was applied for an exit application modal when in "kid-mode". This included setting background color to a vibrant purple, padding, title font size, and button styles with a white border and a distinct vibrant-purple box-shadow on focus.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (28/1/2026, 11:25:02 and 29/1/2026, 10:22:40):** The `ExtraAppModals` component was introduced to the main application for managing additional modals. A day later, the `InitDevConsole()` call was uncommented in a `useEffect` hook, enabling the development console during application startup.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\collectionItems\landscapeItem\index.jsx` (28/1/2026, 13:05:28 and 13:05:51):** The `LandscapeItem` UI was refined by adding a bottom-to-top gradient (`bg-bottom-top-gradient`) and wrapping the item's title within an `infoContainer` for better styling control.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\styles.scss` (28/1/2026, 13:06:46, 14:36:24, 14:52:00, 14:59:35):** This SCSS file underwent multiple minor adjustments. Initially, it defined comprehensive styling for various row types and their content, including detailed focus/hover effects. A small change in `line-height` for `.row-title` occurred, followed by commenting out specific `width` and `height` properties for `.item-show-all.LANDSCAPE`, suggesting a move towards more generalized styling or dynamic sizing.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\router\navigationRoute.js` (28/1/2026, 13:13:07, 13:13:44, 14:32:50, 14:33:53):** The `getNavigationRoute` function was iteratively improved. First, a previously commented-out section for detailed `link` data handling was uncommented, allowing for richer routing based on linked content metadata. Subsequently, a new `user_row` collection type was added to the routing logic, and then consolidated with `menu_link` into a single conditional block for conciseness.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\landscapeItem\styles.scss` (28/1/2026, 15:03:25):** Detailed styling for `landscapeItem` within rows was introduced, defining layouts for tags (including a "live" tag), gradients, platform-specific footers, and different title styles, along with distinct focus/hover effects using red accents.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\components\audioAndSubsMenu\index.jsx` (28/1/2026, 15:55:39):** Kid-mode specific styles (`styles.kids.scss`) were integrated, and minor focus management improvements were made to the audio and subtitle options using `data-block-focus` attributes.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\utils\platformUtils.js` (28/1/2026, 18:18:55 and 29/1/2026, 15:22:21):** The direct injection of `webOSTV.js` library within the `getPlatform` function was first commented out and later entirely removed. This indicates a shift to handling platform-specific script loading at the build configuration level (e.g., via Vite).
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\package.json` (28/1/2026, 18:29:40, 18:29:48, 29/1/2026, 10:18:45, 14:09:03, 14:12:50):** The project's `package.json` saw substantial restructuring. Initially, `preview:sm` was renamed to `preview:smarttv`. On the second day, entire sections for "Base Device Builds" and "SmartTV Builds" were removed, consolidating the build process around "Hosted Webapps" for `smarttv` and `hbbtv`. New `start` scripts combining build and preview steps were added, and deployment scripts were enhanced with "all" commands for streamlined multi-environment deployment.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\3cat_pro\gateway\js\app.js` (multiple timestamps on 28th and 29th):** These files (and similar ones in `build_templates`) concern WebOS gateway application logic. They frequently updated the target `REMOTE` URL for the main application, switching between local development IPs (`http://192.168.1.138:4173/`) and production/preproduction domains (`https://smartv-pro.3cat.website/`). There were also changes in including specific query parameters like `?pr=true` (for parental rating, likely) or `?qr=true` in the redirection URL.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html` (29/1/2026, 10:25:23 and 13:57:28):** Direct script inclusions for webOS and Tizen APIs were removed, and a `purple-console.min.js` script was commented out, then re-enabled. A new placeholder `<!-- [[[ inject platform ]]] -->` was added, indicating a move towards dynamic, build-time platform-specific script injection.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (29/1/2026, 10:37:09, 10:37:16, 10:38:09, 10:44:50, 10:51:24):** This core page component saw iterative changes in error logging and debugging. A minor correction in an error variable name was made, followed by adding and then reverting more verbose `ajsrConsole.log` statements for data fetching errors. Finally, a debug log was added to track the `location` object in a `useEffect` hook.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\tizen\3cat_dev\gateway\js\app.js`, `3cat_pre\gateway\js\app.js`, `3cat_pro\gateway\js\app.js` (29/1/2026, ~10:59):** These gateway scripts for Tizen environments consistently configure `REMOTE` URLs for dev, pre-production, and production, check network connectivity, and handle `VK_BACK`/`VK_EXIT` key events for application exit.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\webos\3cat_dev\gateway\js\app.js`, `3cat_pre\gateway\js\app.js`, `3cat_pro\gateway\js\app.js` (multiple timestamps on 29th):** These WebOS gateway scripts were updated to consistently use `?pr=true` in the `REMOTE` URL, and later, the explicit `index.html` was removed from the URLs, standardizing the path.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\vite.config.js` (multiple timestamps on 29th):** This configuration file underwent extensive changes, reflecting a significant overhaul of the build system.
    *   It manages versioning (updating `.env` file).
    *   It configured legacy browser support (`chrome: "38"`) with specific polyfills.
    *   The HTML injection plugin was refactored multiple times to dynamically inject platform-specific meta tags and scripts (`webOSTV.js`, `$WEBAPIS/webapis/webapis.js`) based on platform detection (User-Agent or `window` properties) directly into `index.html`. This move consolidates runtime script loading and removes the need for separate build processes for WebOS/Tizen.
    *   Removed `__SUPPORTED_DEVICES__` define, indicating a shift away from passing this config via `process.env`.
    *   Platform-specific output directories were adjusted.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Platform Abstraction & Dynamic Loading:** A strong pattern emerges around abstracting platform-specific logic and dynamically loading necessary libraries. This is evident in `platformUtils.js`, `index.html`, and `vite.config.js` working together to detect the platform (WebOS, Tizen, HbbTV) and inject the appropriate SDK scripts at runtime or build time.
2.  **Kid Mode Integration:** The repeated appearance of `styles.kids.scss` and `UserType.KID` in `App.jsx` and `Page.jsx` indicates a dedicated "kid-mode" feature with its own styling and content filtering.
3.  **Build System Refinement (Vite):** `vite.config.js` and `package.json` show continuous iteration on the build and deployment pipeline. The shift from "Base Device Builds" to "Hosted Webapp Builds" and dynamic script injection suggests a strategy to create more flexible and maintainable builds for various SmartTV environments.
4.  **Gateway Redirection Logic:** The `gateway/js/app.js` files consistently implement logic to check network connectivity, determine the correct `REMOTE` URL for the main application (often including specific query parameters like `?pr=true`), and redirect, ensuring the application loads correctly based on the environment and SDK version.
5.  **Debugging & Logging:** The frequent addition/removal of `ajsrConsole.log` statements in `App.jsx` and `Page.jsx` points to an active development cycle with a focus on debugging application flow and data fetching.
6.  **UI/UX Refinements:** Minor adjustments to SCSS files (`genericRow`, `landscapeItem`, `exitAppModal`) demonstrate ongoing visual and layout polishing.
7.  **Error Handling:** Updates to `Page.jsx` reflect an effort to refine error reporting and user feedback during data loading.
