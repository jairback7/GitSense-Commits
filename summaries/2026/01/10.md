# Activity Summary for 10/1/2026

## 2:18:39
The `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx` file underwent several rapid modifications between 7/1/2026, 10:12:02 and 7/1/2026, 10:26:08. These changes primarily focused on refining the logic for determining and assigning the `title` property within the `InfoGroup` component. Specifically:
*   At 10:17:32, a condition `&& !item.title` was added to an `else if` block that sets `title = item.description;` for live "Tematics" items (where `!item.h2 && isLive(item) && !item.stream?.channel`).
*   At 10:21:28, the `&& !item.title` condition was removed, essentially reverting the previous title logic refinement.
*   At 10:23:36, the `else if` condition for "Tematics" was further modified by adding `&& item.collection !== 'link'`.
*   At 10:24:37, a new `else if` block was introduced to explicitly handle title assignment (`title = item.title;`) for live items that are not of `link` collection (`item.title && isLive(item) && item.collection !== 'link'`).
*   At 10:26:08, the condition for this newly added `else if` block was inverted from `item.collection !== 'link'` to `item.collection === 'link'`, indicating a change in how titles for live `link` collection items are sourced.

The `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\index.jsx` file was updated at 8/1/2026, 11:36:05 and then at 8/1/2026, 11:49:43. The significant change was the introduction of `isFirstRow` prop handling. The `RoundRow` component now accepts an `isFirstRow` prop, and this prop is used to conditionally apply a `dataBlockFocusUp: 'true'` attribute to the `RoundItem` components within the first row, preventing focus from moving upwards from the first row.

A new file, `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx`, was logged at 8/1/2026, 11:48:50. This file defines the `RoundItem` component, which is responsible for rendering individual items within a `RoundRow`. Key features include:
*   Dynamic image selection (`round`, `kids-round`, `logo`) based on `item.images` and `isKidsProfile`.
*   Integration with a focus management system (`registerFocusAction`, `unregisterFocusAction`).
*   Conditional rendering of an image or text title.
*   Extensive focus navigation attributes (`data-group`, `data-nav-fixed-focus-shape`, `data-block-focus-up/right/left/down`, `dataOnLostLeftAction`) to control navigation behavior, particularly for the first and last items/rows.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Focus Navigation:** A prominent pattern across `RoundItem` and `RoundRow` is the detailed management of UI focus using custom data attributes like `dataBlockFocusUp`, `dataBlockFocusLeft`, `dataBlockFocusRight`, `dataBlockFocusDown`, and `dataOnLostLeftAction`. This indicates a robust focus engine for smart TV environments.
*   **Conditional Rendering Logic:** Both `infoGroup/index.jsx` and `roundItem/index.jsx` extensively use conditional logic (`if/else if` statements, `&&` operators, `useMemo` dependencies) to determine what content to display, how to display it, and which properties to apply based on item type, collection, user profile (`isKidsProfile`), and other data.
*   **Memoization for Performance:** The use of `memo` for component wrapping and `useMemo` for derived values (like `logoImage`, `channelLogo`, image `type`) is consistently applied for performance optimization in React components.
*   **Context for Settings:** The `useSettings` hook in `infoGroup/index.jsx` suggests a global settings context affecting component behavior, such as `LIVE_REFRESH_INTERVAL`.
*   **Internationalization/Localization:** Functions like `useText`, `formatDateToCatalan`, and `formatCatalanDayMonthWithLabelUTC` indicate support for multiple languages and date formats, particularly Catalan.
*   **External Content Integration:** The `infoGroup/index.jsx` component includes logic for `useExternalEmission` and displays `externalPlatformLogo`, pointing to features for integrating content from external platforms.
