# Activity Summary for 8/1/2026

## 10:46:53
The changes log details modifications to a single file: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx`. This file defines a React component, `InfoGroup`, responsible for displaying various metadata about a media item, such as its title, description, duration, age rating, and live/upcoming event status.

The key updates, all occurring on 7/1/2026, are concentrated on refining the logic for determining the `title` property of a media item within the `InfoGroup` component:

*   **10:17:32 Update:** For live thematic content (`!item.h2 && isLive(item) && !item.stream?.channel`), the title assignment logic was updated. Previously, it would default to `item.title`. The change introduces a fallback: if `item.title` is explicitly *not* present (`!item.title`), then `item.description` is used as the title.
*   **10:21:28 to 10:23:36 Update:** The condition for assigning `item.description` as the title for live thematic content was further refined. The `!item.title` check was replaced with `item.collection !== 'link'`. This means `item.description` will be used as the title for live thematic items that are *not* of the `link` collection, assuming `item.h2` is also absent.
*   **10:23:36 to 10:24:37 Update:** A new condition was added to the title assignment chain. If `item.title` exists, the item is live (`isLive(item)`), and its `collection` is *not* `'link'`, then `item.title` is directly assigned as the title. This specifically addressed live items (not links) that possessed a direct `item.title`.
*   **10:24:37 to 10:26:08 Update:** The newly added condition (from the previous timestamp) was immediately modified. The `item.collection !== 'link'` check was flipped to `item.collection === 'link'`. Consequently, this condition now assigns `item.title` for live items where `item.title` exists AND the `item.collection` *is* specifically `'link'`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

The changes consistently occur within a very short timeframe (14 minutes), indicating a focused effort or rapid iteration on a specific piece of logic. All modifications revolve around the `title` assignment logic, specifically handling various edge cases and conditions for "live" media items and those categorized under the "link" collection. This suggests an ongoing effort to ensure the correct and most appropriate title is displayed for diverse content types within the component.
