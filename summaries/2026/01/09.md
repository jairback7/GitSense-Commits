# Activity Summary for 9/1/2026

## 4:37:13
The provided log details changes across two distinct areas of a SmartTV application: media information display and row-based item navigation.

In the file `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx`, a series of rapid updates occurred on **7/1/2026** between **10:12:02** and **10:26:08**. These changes primarily refined the logic for determining and displaying the `title` of media items within the `InfoGroup` component.
Initially, the component had a complex set of `if/else if` conditions to derive a title from `item.default_episode`, `item.h2`, `item.presenter`, or `item.title` based on factors like `item.media_type`, whether it's `live`, and if `item.stream?.channel` exists.
At **10:17:32**, for live thematic content without `h2` or a `stream.channel`, the title assignment was altered to fall back to `item.description` if `item.title` was also missing.
This was further simplified at **10:21:28**, making `item.description` the default title for such live thematic content, irrespective of whether `item.title` existed.
By **10:23:36**, a new condition `item.collection !== 'link'` was added, restricting this `item.description` fallback specifically to live thematic items that are *not* part of a 'link' collection.
A new `else if` block was introduced at **10:24:37** to explicitly use `item.title` for live items where the `collection` is *not* 'link', when previous title conditions weren't met.
Finally, at **10:26:08**, the condition in this last `else if` was inverted, making `item.title` specifically used for live items *only if* their `collection` *is* 'link'.
The recurring pattern in these changes is a continuous refinement of conditional logic to precisely control which property (`title`, `h2`, `description`, `presenter`) is used for the display title, especially for `live` content and different content `collection` types, indicating an effort to improve content labeling accuracy.

Regarding the navigation components, `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\index.jsx` and `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx` show updates on **8/1/2026**.
At **11:36:05**, the `RoundRow` component was structured to render a horizontal row of `RoundItem` components, incorporating basic focus management for the first and last items in the row.
The `RoundItem` component, detailed at **11:48:50**, handles individual item rendering, image selection (with special logic for 'kids' profiles and 'round' vs 'logo' image formats), and integrates with a custom focus action registry (`registerFocusAction`, `unregisterFocusAction`) for advanced UI navigation. It also uses custom `data-` attributes like `data-block-focus-up`, `data-block-focus-right`, etc., for spatial navigation control.
A significant update occurred in `roundRow\index.jsx` at **11:49:43**, where an `isFirstRow` prop was added to the `RoundRow` component. This new prop is passed down to each `RoundItem` and is used to conditionally apply a `dataBlockFocusUp='true'` attribute.
The pattern here highlights ongoing work on enhancing the application's navigation system, particularly concerning focus boundaries for rows and individual items. The introduction of `isFirstRow` specifically addresses preventing focus from moving upwards from the first row, indicating a refinement in the overall user experience for navigating content rows with a remote control or keyboard.
