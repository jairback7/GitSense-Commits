# Activity Summary for 12/1/2026

## 1:36:03
In the `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx` file, a series of focused updates occurred on **7/1/2026**. This file defines the `InfoGroup` React component, which is responsible for displaying various metadata about a media item (title, description, duration, tags, age rating, etc.). The changes primarily revolve around refining the logic for determining the `title` of a media item under different conditions, especially for "live" content:

*   **10:17:32**: The logic for setting the `title` for live streams (specifically "Tematics" type, where `item.h2`, `item.stream?.channel`, and `item.title` are missing) was modified to fallback to `item.description`.
*   **10:21:28**: This title determination logic was further simplified by removing an unnecessary check for `!item.title`.
*   **10:23:36**: A condition `item.collection !== 'link'` was added to the "Tematics" title logic, preventing `item.description` from being used as a title for items belonging to the 'link' collection.
*   **10:24:37**: A new `else if` block was introduced to explicitly set `title = item.title` for live items that have a title and are not of `collection === 'link'`.
*   **10:26:08**: The condition added at 10:24:37 was immediately revised. It now sets `title = item.title` for live items *only if* they have a title and *are* of `collection === 'link'`.

Throughout these changes, a commented-out `Publication` component and its associated `showPublication` `useMemo` were consistently present, indicating a planned removal or deprecation related to "JIRA CCMA-2104: Eliminamos funcionalidad 'A partir del'". The component also uses `useMemo` for `logoImage` and `channelLogo` and integrates `useExternalEmission` for handling external content, displaying appropriate `MediaTag` and `externalPlatformLogo`.

In the `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\index.jsx` file, on **8/1/2026 at 11:49:43**, an update was made to improve focus management within rows. The `RoundRow` component, which displays a horizontal list of `RoundItem`s, now accepts an `isFirstRow` prop. This prop is conditionally used to apply `dataBlockFocusUp='true'` to the individual `RoundItem` children when the `RoundRow` itself is the first row, enhancing navigation behavior.

The `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx` file, recorded on **8/1/2026 at 11:48:50**, defines the `RoundItem` component. This component dynamically selects an image (`round` or `logo`) based on `isKidsProfile` and item image formats. It heavily relies on a `focusActionRegistry` for handling UI focus events and applies various `data-*` attributes for advanced navigation control, such as `data-block-focus-up`, `data-block-focus-right`, `data-block-focus-left`, and `data-block-focus-down` (specifically if it's the last item in a row).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focus and Navigation Management:** A strong pattern across these UI components is the explicit and detailed handling of UI focus, particularly relevant for Smart TV applications. This is evident through the use of `data-block-focus-*` attributes, `focusActionRegistry`, and conditional props like `isFirstRow` and `isLastRow`.
*   **Conditional Rendering and Data Transformation:** Components frequently use conditional logic (`if`/`else if` statements, ternary operators, `&&`) and `useMemo` hooks to dynamically render elements and derive data (like `title`, `image` paths, or `expirationInfo`) based on complex item properties and application settings.
*   **Context and Utilities:** The `InfoGroup` component utilizes `useSettings` from `settingsContext` and various utility functions for image handling (`getLogoImage`), text localization (`useText`), and time formatting (`formatDateToCatalan`, `formatCatalanDayMonthWithLabelUTC`), indicating a layered architecture for data and presentation.
*   **JIRA References in Comments:** The presence of JIRA ticket numbers (e.g., `CCMA-1685`, `CCMA-2104`) in comments suggests that code changes are directly linked to specific project requirements, bug fixes, or feature removals.
*   **Performance Optimization:** The consistent use of `memo` for components and `useMemo` for derived values highlights an emphasis on performance optimization, crucial for responsive user interfaces.
