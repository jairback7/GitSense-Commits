This file, a Node.js script for packaging smart TV applications (WebOS and Tizen), underwent significant iterative development within a short period on **January 14, 2026**.

*   **Initial Version (14/1/2026, 12:28:33):** The script was established with core functionalities: parsing CLI arguments (`platform`, `env`), reading `package.json` for app name, resolving output directories, and executing platform-specific packaging commands (`ares-package` for WebOS, `tizen package` for Tizen). It used temporary directories for Tizen to keep templates clean and handled renaming the final package.
*   **Introduction of WebOS Multi-Resolution and Tizen Signing (14/1/2026, 12:31:38):**
    *   Multi-resolution packaging for WebOS (LG) was implemented, generating separate packages for 720p and 1080p resolutions. This involved copying the template, modifying `appinfo.json` (setting `screenWidth` and `screenHeight`), packaging, and renaming each output with a resolution suffix.
    *   For Tizen `PRO` environment, a `readlineSync` prompt was added to ask for a certificate/profile name for signing.
*   **Refinement of WebOS and Tizen Cleanup (14/1/2026, 12:36:07):** The logging for WebOS package generation was moved inside the resolution loop for immediate feedback. Minor adjustments were made to temporary directory cleanup, ensuring `removeDirRecursive` and `fs.rmdirSync` were used consistently for Tizen.
*   **Simplified Tizen PRO Signing Prompt (14/1/2026, 12:39:35):** The `readlineSync` module and explicit certificate prompt were removed for Tizen `PRO` builds. Instead, a `console.log` message was added, indicating that the Tizen CLI would handle the certificate prompt itself if multiple profiles existed, implying the `-s` flag was no longer explicitly used by the script.
*   **WebOS `appinfo.json` Update and Post-Packaging Flow (14/1/2026, 12:48:19 and 12:54:31):**
    *   The way `appinfo.json` was modified for WebOS changed: instead of setting `screenWidth` and `screenHeight` separately, it began setting a single `appinfo.resolution` string (e.g., "1280x720"). The `pkgVersion` was also added to `appinfo.json`.
    *   The WebOS package renaming logic was overhauled: instead of renaming each package immediately, all packages for both resolutions are generated first, and then the script iterates to find and rename them based on the resolution suffix. JSDoc comments were also removed from utility functions.
*   **Enhanced Tizen PRO Signing Profile Selection (14/1/2026, 13:13:19 and 13:18:23):**
    *   The `readlineSync` module was replaced with Node.js's standard `readline` module.
    *   A new function `chooseTizenProfile` was introduced. This function lists available Tizen security profiles by running `tizen security-profiles list`, prompts the user to select one, and then uses the selected profile to sign the Tizen `PRO` package via the `tizen package --sign` command. This significantly improved the user experience for Tizen PRO signing.
*   **Tizen `config.xml` Version Update (14/1/2026, 13:56:41):** Logic was added to update the `version` attribute within the `config.xml` file for Tizen packages, ensuring the version from `package.json` is correctly reflected in the Tizen manifest.
*   **Redundant WebOS Cleanup (14/1/2026, 14:02:48):** A minor, likely redundant, `fs.rmdirSync` call was added after `removeDirRecursive` in the WebOS packaging loop.

**File: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx`**

*   **Single Entry (14/1/2026, 14:17:53 and 16:02:00):** This React component, `InfoGroup`, is responsible for displaying a media item's detailed information, including title, description, tags, duration, age rating, and various counts (episodes, seasons).
    *   It uses `useMemo` for performance optimization, particularly for image fetching (`logoImage`, `channelLogo`).
    *   The component contains complex conditional logic to determine which information to display based on `item` properties (e.g., `isLive`, `isUpcomingEvent`, `is_episode`, `tag_format`).
    *   It includes a `showExpiration` function to display availability dates if content expires within three months.
    *   Notably, code related to a "Publication" feature (`Publication` component and related logic) is commented out with a JIRA reference "CCMA-2104: Eliminamos funcionalidad 'A partir del'", indicating a removed or deferred feature.
    *   It integrates an `useExternalEmission` hook for handling external content dates and displaying relevant tags.
    *   The code at 16:02:00 is identical to 14:17:53, suggesting no functional changes were committed in that later timestamp.

**File: `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\styles.scss`**

*   **Single Entry (14/1/2026, 16:13:54):** This SCSS file defines the styling for various types of content rows within the application (`.generic_row`). It specifies layout properties (width, height, padding, margins) and appearance for different row types like `_HERO`, `_BANNER`, `_LANDSCAPE`, `_LIVE_TV`, `_SQUARE`, and `_PORTRAIT`.
    *   It also defines the styling for a "show all" item (`.item-show-all`), including its icon and visual feedback for hover and focused states, which feature a red box-shadow and border using the `$base-color-3cat-red` variable.
    *   Several properties are prefixed with `_` (e.g., `_background-color`, `_width`, `_height`), which typically indicates commented-out or temporary debugging styles.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements Across Changes:**

*   **Focused Development Session:** All changes for `package-launcher-apps.cjs` occurred on the same day, January 14, 2026, within a few hours, indicating a dedicated and iterative development session for the build script. The UI component and style file changes occurred later the same day, likely reflecting related development.
*   **Platform Specificity:** The `package-launcher-apps.cjs` script consistently distinguishes between WebOS and Tizen platforms, implementing separate logic paths for packaging commands, manifest modifications (`appinfo.json` vs. `config.xml`), and signing processes.
*   **Cleanup and Templating:** A common pattern in `package-launcher-apps.cjs` is the use of temporary directories, copying templates into them, performing modifications/packaging, and then cleaning up these temporary directories.
*   **Versioning from `package.json`:** The script consistently retrieves the application version from `package.json` to embed it into the generated package manifests.
*   **UI Component Design:** `infoGroup/index.jsx` shows a pattern of highly conditional rendering and memoization, indicating an emphasis on performance and adaptive display based on media item properties. The presence of commented-out code (like "JIRA CCMA-2104") suggests features are actively being managed or removed.
*   **SCSS Structure:** `genericRow/styles.scss` utilizes SCSS's nesting capabilities to organize styles efficiently by component and state, with a clear focus on responsive layouts for various row types.
