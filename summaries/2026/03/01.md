# Activity Summary for 1/3/2026

## 1:53:15
The provided log details changes across several files, primarily focusing on updates related to the `Page` component, player functionality, and keyboard navigation within a Smart TV application.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx`** (20/2/2026, 12:11:57 - 24/2/2026, 14:44:26):
    *   This file experienced the most frequent modifications, indicating active development on the main page rendering and live content updating logic.
    *   **Live Refresh Interval:** Initially set to `3000` (12:11:57), then changed to `10000` (12:12:08), then made dynamic `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000` (12:27:43), then temporarily hardcoded to `3000` (23/2/2026, 15:47:34), then back to dynamic (23/2/2026, 16:47:49). This value fluctuated between a hardcoded `3000` or `10000` and relying on `settingsData` for `live_refresh_interval` (or defaulting to `10000`), suggesting experimentation with live data refresh rates. It was later hardcoded to `2000` (23/2/2026, 23:39:38) and then back to `10000` (24/2/2026, 0:00:35), before being set to a very large `6000000` (24/2/2026, 13:07:41) and finally reverting to `10000` (24/2/2026, 14:15:08). This indicates extensive testing and fine-tuning of the live refresh mechanism.
    *   **Page Data Filtering and Updates:**
        *   Changes were made to how `pageData` is updated within the `checkTimeFrame` function. Initially, `setPageData` was called directly.
        *   Around 23/2/2026, 17:31:09, the line `setPageData({ ...homeDataRef.current, children: filterChildren(homeDataRef.current) });` was commented out and `homeDataRef.current` was directly updated instead: `homeDataRef.current = { ...homeDataRef.current, children: filterChildren(homeDataRef.current) };`. This was followed by attempts to conditionally call `setPageData` only if `!hasRefreshed.current` (23/2/2026, 17:32:44), then removing this condition and calling `setPageData` directly (23/2/2026, 19:01:47).
        *   More robust logic for updating `pageData` was introduced (23/2/2026, 19:09:03), differentiating between initial render (`!hasRefreshed.current`) and subsequent live row updates (`livePositionsToUpdate.size > 0`). This involved careful management of state updates to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
        *   Around 24/2/2026, 0:04:01, the logic was simplified to only update `pageData` if `prev.children` is not strictly equal to `newChildren`, aiming to prevent redundant renders. This logic continued to evolve, attempting to handle `rowsChanged` scenarios by calling `navigate(location.pathname, { replace: true })` which effectively reloads the page (24/2/2026, 14:24:54). This navigation-based reset was further refined to explicitly reset virtualization and fixed focus states before navigating (24/2/2026, 14:27:05).
    *   **Simulated Row Removal:** A `useEffect` hook was temporarily added (24/2/2026, 13:40:08) to simulate the removal of a row (specifically, `splice(3, 1)` on `homeDataRef.current.children`) every 10 seconds, and then reverted (24/2/2026, 14:15:08). This suggests testing dynamic content changes and their impact on virtualization.
    *   **Filter Children Logic:** A temporary filter `c = c.filter((_, index) => index !== 3);` was added and then removed in the `checkTimeFrame` function in a few iterations (24/2/2026, 12:57:22 to 24/2/2026, 14:36:17). This indicates testing how row removal affects the display and state.
    *   **Reset on Row Count Change:** Logic was added and refined to trigger `resetVirtualization`, `removeVirtualizationState`, `resetFixedFocus`, and navigate to the current path (`navigate(location.pathname, { replace: true })`) when the number of children in `pageData` changes (`prev.children.length != newChildren.length`) (24/2/2026, 14:17:47, 14:43:58, 14:44:26). This is crucial for handling dynamic content structures that would invalidate current virtualization state.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html`** (20/2/2026, 12:16:22):
    *   Minor update: `shaka-4-7-1.js` was commented out and `shaka.4.13.8.js` was added, indicating an upgrade or change in the Shaka Player version used.
    *   `ima3.js` for Google IMA SDK was added, signifying integration of advertisement functionality.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx`** (20/2/2026, 12:16:57):
    *   Several `Route` paths were updated or added, including `'/page/:id'`, `'/home'`, `'/live'`, `'/catalog'`, `'/accessible-content'`, `'/my-list'`, `'/continue-watching'`, `'/epg'`, `'/search'`, `'/configuration'`, `'/c/:contentId'`, `'/pr/:contentId'`, `'/s/:contentId'`, `'/m/:contentId'`, `'/media/:id'`, `'/stream/:id'`, and `/:slug`. This indicates a significant expansion or redefinition of the application's routing structure.
    *   Many context providers (`VirtualizationProvider`, `AuthContextProvider`, `BroadcastProvider`, `HistoryProvider`, `SitecatalystProvider`, `CapabilitiesProvider`, `OptionsProvider`, `DidomiProvider`, `ParentalControlProvider`, `SettingsContextProvider`, `TextsContextProvider`, `HighlightProvider`) were integrated, suggesting a more robust and modular state management architecture.
    *   Debug components (`DebugModalsLauncher`, `DebugConfigPane`, `DebugSessionSettingsPane`) and a `BuildInfo` component were added, pointing to enhanced debugging and build information display capabilities.
    *   Introduction of `window.triggerFocusAction` and `window.triggerBlurAction`, and an `onVisibilityChange` handler, for managing focus and visibility within the application.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js`** (20/2/2026, 13:13:26):
    *   Updates to Tizen-specific platform interactions, including `initAppTizen` for device info and visibility changes, `initNetworkStateListener` for network state, `initExtraSamsungKeys` for remote key registration, and `launchAppTizen`/`openSamsungStore` for app control and store interaction.
    *   Extensive logging with `ajsrConsole` for debugging Tizen platform features.
    *   Integration with `window.AppGlobal.Player` for pausing/playing on visibility changes.
    *   Screen saver management logic (`initScreenSaverHelpers`, `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.enable/disable`).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerLoader.jsx`** (20/2/2026, 18:52:39):
    *   Introduction of `window.BufferingIndicator.show()` and `hide()` in `useEffect` for managing buffering UI, implying enhanced player state feedback.
    *   Ad-related logic was updated to use `build3catVmapUrl` and `getVmapParamsPlatform`, replacing simple query stripping. This signifies more sophisticated ad integration with macro replacement.
    *   Subtitle styling (`setSubtitlesStyles`, `removeSubtitlesStyles`) was added, allowing for dynamic control over subtitle appearance.
    *   `LiveAudioDataRefresh` interval management for audio streams was added.
    *   Integration with `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.disable/enable` for player-specific screensaver control.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js`** (20/2/2026, 18:58:23 - 20/2/2026, 19:25:16):
    *   Keyboard navigation was refined, including `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` in `onKeyDownHandler` (added at 19:05:58 and `e.stopPropagation()` later moved inside the function at 19:21:43), potentially to prevent unwanted browser/platform default actions. `e.stopPropagation()` was removed from the general `onKeyDownHandler` and only applied in some specific cases during testing at 19:15:17, and then put back into some keys but not all in following commits, suggesting a focused approach to event propagation. Ultimately, `e.stopPropagation()` was reintroduced for `onKeyDownHandler` but only after specific platform handling, aiming for more control over event flow (20/2/2026, 19:21:43).
    *   New debug keys (`1`, `2`, `3`) were added for enabling/disabling ads and displaying build numbers, highlighting debugging capabilities.
    *   Specific key codes for WebOS and Tizen platforms were added to control player actions (play, pause, stop, rewind, fast forward), indicating cross-platform compatibility development.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss`** (23/2/2026, 12:40:42):
    *   Added `@font-face` rules for "Bw 3Cat" and "Roboto" fonts, including different weights and styles, improving the application's typography. The `body` element was set to use "Bw 3Cat".

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx`** (23/2/2026, 17:26:19 - 23/2/2026, 17:27:28):
    *   An `setInterval` in `useEffect` was removed (23/2/2026, 17:27:28), indicating a change in how favorite status is refreshed locally. The `refresh_LOCAL_FavoritesList` is now called only once on mount.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx`** (23/2/2026, 19:07:16):
    *   Added `icLinkExterior` import and logic to display an external link icon and platform logo for external content.
    *   Introduced `useExternalEmission` hook to determine `isLiveExternal` and `whiteTagText`, enhancing handling of external live content.
    *   The `navFixedFocusShape` now dynamically includes `' external-content'` for external items, suggesting improved focus management for such content.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx`** (24/2/2026, 10:52:48 - 24/2/2026, 14:18:59):
    *   Significant refactoring of virtualization logic.
    *   **Wrap-around Navigation:** Implemented wrap-around navigation for rows (going from last row to first when pressing 'down', and vice-versa for 'up') at 24/2/2026, 10:56:20.
    *   **Window Calculation and `accumulatedTop`:** Refined the logic for calculating `newVisibleRows` and updating `accumulatedTop` based on changes in the visible window's start index, ensuring smooth scrolling.
    *   **`syncVirtualizationWithData`:** A new function `syncVirtualizationWithData` was temporarily exported (24/2/2026, 14:07:27) and then removed, indicating an attempt to externalize synchronization logic which was later reverted or integrated differently.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx`** (24/2/2026, 20:47:55):
    *   The `generateShowAllElements` function was moved inside the `GenericRow` component at some point (implied from the timestamp, not explicitly shown as a diff but a full code snapshot), indicating a change in how the "show all" button is rendered and focused.
    *   Refined the `onFocusAction` logic for `RowElement`, ensuring `teasers` are set to `null` and `dismissFadeIn` is `true` for certain row types, improving focus handling and UI transitions.
    *   Added conditional attributes for `dataBlockFocusUp`, `dataBlockFocusLeft`, `dataBlockFocusRight`, `dataOnLostLeftAction` based on item position (`isFirst`, `isLast`, `isFirstRow`) and `moreRowItemsAvailable`, enabling more precise focus control.
    *   Added a `showAudioIcon` prop to `RowElement`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focus Management:** There's a strong recurring pattern of detailed focus management across multiple files, especially in `Page.jsx`, `generic.js`, and `liveItemHome.jsx`. This involves:
    *   Use of `nav.fixedFocus.isNavigating` to control navigation behavior.
    *   Registering and unregistering focus actions (`registerFocusAction`, `unregisterFocusAction`).
    *   Extensive use of `data-group`, `data-group-restore-last-focused`, `data-nav-fixed-focus-shape`, `data-block-focus-up/down/left/right` attributes for fine-grained control over navigation and focus.
    *   `resetFixedFocus()` is called in `onReset` in `Page.jsx` and in `useEffect` initialization, ensuring a consistent focus state.
*   **Live Data Refresh:** The `Page.jsx` component consistently implements a live data refresh mechanism using `setInterval` and `ApiGetNowPlaying`/`ApiGetNowPlayingSelector`. The interval duration is frequently adjusted, indicating ongoing optimization or testing of this feature. The `checkTimeFrame` function is central to updating live content and slider items.
*   **Virtualization:** The `useVirtualizedRows` hook is actively developed, with changes aimed at improving smooth scrolling, windowing logic, and state persistence for large lists of rows. This includes handling `accumulatedTranslate`, `accumulatedTop`, `currentRow`, and `visibleRows` efficiently. The changes related to `syncVirtualizationWithData` and directly handling row count changes in `Page.jsx` highlight efforts to maintain a consistent UI state even when the underlying data structure (number of rows) changes dynamically.
*   **Platform Specificity:** The presence of `platform` checks (`window.AppGlobal.platform === 'hbbtv'`, `'webos'`, `'tizen'`) and platform-specific keyboard handling (`generic.js`) demonstrates the application's multi-platform nature and the need for tailored logic for different Smart TV environments. Filtering of children in `Page.jsx` based on platform capabilities (`isLiveSupportedRef.current`, `isShakaPlayerSupportedRef.current`) and external content handling (`hasExternalChild`) reinforces this.
*   **State Management with Refs and Hooks:** Extensive use of `useRef`, `useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` is evident across the React components, pointing to a functional component-based architecture with careful attention to performance optimizations and state management.
*   **Error Handling and Authentication:** API calls (`ApiHome`, `ApiContent_NO_PROMISE`, `ApiStreamData`) consistently include error handling, often leading to `logout()` or navigation to an authentication screen (`/qrAuthScreen`) in case of `Unauthorized` or `Token expired` errors. This ensures a robust user experience in authenticated environments.
*   **Filtering Logic:** The `filterChildren` function in `Page.jsx` is a recurring element, dynamically adjusting the displayed content based on platform capabilities (e.g., live support, Shaka player support), content format (e.g., hiding non-live children in sliders if live is not supported), and user type (e.g., hiding 'user_row' for kid users).

Overall, the changes reflect a continuous effort to improve performance, user experience, platform compatibility, and maintainability of a content-rich Smart TV application, with particular emphasis on dynamic content updates and intricate navigation logic.

## 2:53:10
The provided log details changes across several files, primarily focusing on React components and platform-specific implementations, indicating an ongoing development or maintenance cycle for a Smart TV application named "3cat_smarttv".

### File-Specific Updates:

#### `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (20/2/2026, 12:11:57 - 24/2/2026, 14:44:26)
This file, a React component named `Page`, undergoes extensive modifications across numerous commits, indicating active development in its core logic.
*   **Initial Changes (20/2/2026, 12:11:57 - 12:12:08):** A minor change in the `live_refresh_interval` from `3000` to `10000` (commented out in the first commit) and then back to using `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000` in the final change within this initial sequence. This suggests experimentation with the live content refresh rate.
*   **Data Handling Refinements (23/2/2026, 19:09:03):** The `checkTimeFrame` function is significantly refactored to improve how live data is updated. It now explicitly tracks `livePositionsToUpdate` using a `Set`, prevents direct mutation of `homeDataRef.current` by creating `updatedRow` and `newSliderChildren` objects, and introduces a more efficient rendering strategy where full page data is set only once (`hasRefresred.current` check) and subsequent updates for live rows only modify the relevant children to avoid unnecessary re-renders. This is a crucial optimization for performance.
*   **Experimental Row Removal (23/2/2026, 23:31:18 - 24/2/2026, 14:17:47):** A recurring pattern emerges where the `checkTimeFrame` function includes commented-out or active code that attempts to remove the 3rd item (index 3) from the `children` array of `homeDataRef.current` and then sets `pageData`. This code appears and disappears or is commented out multiple times, suggesting testing or debugging related to dynamic row management and potential issues with data mutations and React state updates. There's also an attempt to add a `setTimeout` to filter children after a delay, which is later removed.
*   **Virtualization State Reset in `checkTimeFrame` (24/2/2026, 13:46:15):** The logic within `checkTimeFrame` is updated to call `resetVirtualization()` and `removeVirtualizationState(location.pathname)` and `resetFixedFocus()` if the number of children rows changes (`prev.children.length != newChildren.length`). This is a significant change aimed at re-initializing the virtualization and focus state when the data structure of the page's rows is altered. It also introduces a `navigate(location.pathname, { replace: true })` call to force a re-render/re-initialization of the page.
*   **Reverted `live_refresh_interval` Modification (23/2/2026, 15:47:34, 23/2/2026, 23:39:38, 24/2/2026, 0:00:35, 24/2/2026, 0:00:58, 24/2/2026, 0:01:26):** The `live_refresh_interval` variable is repeatedly changed to hardcoded values like `3000`, `2000`, `1000`, and then back to `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`. This suggests fine-tuning or testing of the live content refresh rate for performance or responsiveness.
*   **Removal of `prevChildrenCount` ref (24/2/2026, 14:19:35):** The `prevChildrenCount` ref is removed from the component, indicating that the logic relying on it might have been refactored or deemed unnecessary, possibly replaced by the direct comparison `prev.children.length != newChildren.length` within the `setPageData` updater.

#### `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html` (20/2/2026, 12:16:22)
*   The `index.html` file saw an update to its Shaka Player library version, changing `shaka-4-7-1.js` to `shaka.4.13.8.js`. This is a significant upgrade, likely for performance, feature, or bug fix improvements in the media player.
*   It also contains several commented-out script tags, indicating that different player or analytics scripts were considered or previously used.

#### `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (20/2/2026, 12:16:57)
*   No significant functional code changes are observed. The provided snapshot is a full component code, but no diffs are present to show specific changes from previous versions. It imports a wide array of contexts and components, highlighting the application's complexity and modular architecture. It also includes debug console initialization and platform/keyboard setup.

#### `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (20/2/2026, 13:13:26)
*   This file outlines Tizen-specific platform initialization, including fetching device info, setting up `visibilitychange` event listeners (to pause/play media on app visibility changes), and an `evExitApplication` listener to cleanly exit the Tizen app.
*   It also includes functions for network state listening, screen saver management (enabling/disabling), and registering extra Samsung TV remote keys (Play/Pause, Fast Forward, Rewind, Stop, Color keys, numeric keys, ChannelUp/Down).
*   There's also logic for launching other Tizen applications and opening the Samsung Store, suggesting integration with the platform's ecosystem.
*   No diffs are provided to show specific changes within this file.

#### `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerLoader.jsx` (20/2/2026, 18:52:39)
*   No diffs are provided for this file. The content shows a React component responsible for loading and configuring the media player. Key functionalities include:
    *   Fetching stream data, related content, and live extra parameters.
    *   Handling subtitles styling based on user options.
    *   Managing ad tag URLs, specifically transitioning from stripping query params to replacing macros with real values for VMAP URLs.
    *   Starting and stopping a `LiveAudioDataRefresh` interval for live audio streams.
    *   Integration with global `AppGlobal.ScreenSaver` and `AppGlobal.Player` actions.

#### `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (20/2/2026, 18:58:23 - 20/2/2026, 19:25:16)
*   This file handles generic keyboard navigation for Smart TV platforms.
*   **Keydown Event Handling (20/2/2026, 19:05:58):** The `onKeyDownHandler` function is modified to include `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` at the beginning, ensuring that key presses are handled by the application's navigation system and don't trigger default browser/platform actions or bubble up unnecessarily.
*   **Removal of `e.stopPropagation()` (20/2/2026, 19:15:17):** The `e.stopPropagation()` call within the `onKeyDownHandler` is removed, suggesting a re-evaluation of event propagation, possibly allowing some events to bubble up for other listeners.
*   **Re-addition of `e.stopPropagation()` (20/2/2026, 19:21:43):** The `e.stopPropagation()` is re-added, but this time at the *end* of the `onKeyDownHandler` function, after the platform-specific key handling. This indicates a very specific control over event flow: preventing default actions always, but only stopping propagation after all custom logic has run.
*   **Minor change (20/2/2026, 19:25:16):** The `e.stopPropagation()` moved again to the end of the `onKeyDownHandler` function.

#### `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss` (23/2/2026, 12:40:42)
*   No diffs are provided. This file defines `@font-face` rules for "Bw 3Cat" and "Roboto" font families, ensuring consistent typography across the application. It specifies multiple font weights and formats (truetype, woff).

#### `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 17:26:19 - 23/2/2026, 17:27:28)
*   **Removal of `setInterval` (23/2/2026, 17:27:28):** The `setInterval` call within the first `useEffect` hook (which was refreshing local favorites every 3 seconds) is removed. This suggests that the automatic periodic refresh of favorite status was either moved elsewhere, deemed inefficient, or is no longer required in this component. The initial `refresh_LOCAL_FavoritesList()` call remains.

#### `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 19:07:16)
*   No diffs are provided for this file. This React component displays live content items, handling image cropping, channel logos, external content tags, and a progress bar for live events. It also registers and unregisters focus actions for keyboard navigation.

#### `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx` (24/2/2026, 10:52:48 - 24/2/2026, 14:18:59)
*   This custom React hook manages row virtualization and navigation state.
*   **Row Navigation Logic Update (24/2/2026, 10:56:20):** The `handleRowNavigation` function is significantly refined.
    *   For "down" navigation, if the current row is the last, it now wraps around to `newCurrentRow = 0` and resets `accumulatedTranslate`, `accumulatedTop`, and `visibleRows`.
    *   New logic is added to adjust `accumulatedTop` based on whether the visible window is moving up or down, indicating a more precise control over scroll positioning.
    *   The `currentRow` and `visibleRows` are updated more explicitly after calculations.
*   **Removal of `syncVirtualizationWithData` from exports (24/2/2026, 14:18:59):** The `syncVirtualizationWithData` function is removed from the return object of the `useVirtualizedRows` hook, implying that this specific synchronization logic is no longer exposed or used by components consuming this hook, possibly because it was integrated differently or found unnecessary.

#### `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (24/2/2026, 20:47:55)
*   No diffs are provided. This React component renders a generic row of items, dynamically selecting the item type based on `rowType` (e.g., `LandscapeItem`, `MiniItem`, `LiveItemHome`). It handles row titles, scroll containers, and generates "Show All" elements for navigability. It also manages focus actions for its child items.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

1.  **Date `20/2/2026` and `23/2/2026` and `24/2/2026`:** A large number of changes occur on these dates, suggesting focused development sprints or bug-fixing periods.
2.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx`:** This file is the most frequently modified, indicating it's a central component in the application's UI, likely representing a home screen or a generic content page. Many changes revolve around:
    *   **Live Data Refresh:** Continuous adjustments to the `live_refresh_interval` and the `checkTimeFrame` function's logic for processing and updating live stream data and slider content. This highlights the importance of real-time content display and performance optimization.
    *   **State Management and Re-renders:** Repeated modifications related to how `pageData` is set (e.g., using a direct update vs. a `prev` function, or introducing `hasRefreshed.current` to control initial vs. subsequent renders). There's a clear effort to optimize re-renders by only updating `pageData` when truly necessary or only specific parts of it.
    *   **Virtualization and Navigation Reset:** Frequent explicit calls to `resetVirtualization()`, `removeVirtualizationState()`, and `resetFixedFocus()` within various `useEffect` hooks and data processing functions. This indicates challenges in maintaining a consistent UI state across navigation and data changes, especially when dealing with dynamic content (like rows being added/removed). The `navigate(location.pathname, { replace: true });` also appears, suggesting a hard refresh to re-initialize component state.
    *   **`filterChildren` Function:** This function is consistently used to modify the `children` array of `pageData`, filtering items based on `isLiveSupportedRef.current`, `isShakaPlayerSupportedRef.current`, and platform-specific logic (e.g., `hbbtv` external content, `UserType.KID` for `user_row`). This indicates a responsive and platform-adaptive content display strategy.
3.  **`live_refresh_interval` Tuning:** The live content refresh interval (`live_refresh_interval`) is a recurring point of modification in `index.jsx`, with values being hardcoded and then reverted to dynamic settings, indicating iterative testing or fine-tuning of live content updates.
4.  **Event Handling:** In `generic.js`, the precise placement and usage of `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` in keyboard event handlers show careful consideration of event flow and potential conflicts with native browser behaviors or other event listeners, crucial for Smart TV applications.
5.  **Focus Management:** The use of `useFixedFocus` and `useVirtualizedRows` hooks, along with explicit calls to `nav.focusById()` and `nav.fixedFocus.isNavigating`, points to a robust and complex focus management system, essential for non-mouse-based navigation in Smart TV environments.
6.  **`window.AppGlobal` Usage:** Frequent interactions with the global `window.AppGlobal` object (`AppGlobal.Slider.wasSliderRowRendered`, `AppGlobal.Player`, `AppGlobal.Actions.openExitAppModal`, `AppGlobal.platform`) indicate a pattern of global state and utility management, common in larger applications or those requiring platform-specific integrations.
7.  **Comments:** Many code blocks, especially in `index.jsx`, include commented-out logic (e.g., `//break; //To concat only first one`, `// Previous version: We just stripped query params...`) which suggests active debugging, experimentation, or A/B testing of different approaches.
