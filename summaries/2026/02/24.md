# Activity Summary for 24/2/2026

## 1:54:29
The provided log details changes across several files in the `3cat_smarttv` project, primarily focusing on a `Page` React component, global keyboard navigation, the main `App` component, and a `BtnFavorite` component.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx`** (Numerous changes between 20/2/2026, 12:11:57 and 24/2/2026, 0:14:17):
    *   **Initial Changes (20/2/2026, 12:11:57 - 12:12:08):** A minor adjustment to the `live_refresh_interval` variable, changing it from `3000` to `10000` (and commenting out the direct assignment in favor of `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`).
    *   **Refinement of `live_refresh_interval` (20/2/2026, 12:27:43):** The hardcoded `3000` was removed, making `live_refresh_interval` consistently derive from `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval` or default to `10000`.
    *   **State Update Logic in `checkTimeFrame` (23/2/2026, 17:31:09 - 23/2/2026, 19:01:47):**
        *   An intermediate change directly updated `homeDataRef.current` without triggering a re-render via `setPageData`, commenting out the `setPageData` call.
        *   A subsequent change introduced a more complex update logic to `checkTimeFrame`:
            *   It tracks `livePositionsToUpdate` to only update relevant rows.
            *   It distinguishes between the "first render" (`!hasRefreshed.current`) which triggers a full `setPageData` and subsequent refreshes which attempt to update `pageData` only if `newChildren` is different from `prev.children`, aiming for optimized re-renders.
            *   Later, this optimized update logic (using `livePositionsToUpdate` and `isSame` checks) was commented out or removed, reverting to a simpler `setPageData({ ...homeDataRef.current, children: filterChildren(homeDataRef.current) })`.
    *   **`live_refresh_interval` adjustments (23/2/2026, 15:47:34, 23/2/2026, 23:39:38, 23/2/2026, 23:58:29, 24/2/2026, 0:00:35, 24/2/2026, 0:00:58, 24/2/2026, 0:01:26, 24/2/2026, 0:04:01, 24/2/2026, 0:06:46, 24/2/2026, 0:08:59, 24/2/2026, 0:10:46, 24/2/2026, 0:13:24, 24/2/2026, 0:14:17):** There are many minor modifications to the `live_refresh_interval` variable, toggling between hardcoded values like `3000`, `2000`, `1000`, and the `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000` expression. This suggests ongoing testing or fine-tuning of the live content refresh rate.
    *   **Re-introduction and Refinement of Optimized `setPageData` (24/2/2026, 0:04:01 - 24/2/2026, 0:08:59):** The `checkTimeFrame` function was again modified to include logic for avoiding unnecessary re-renders when updating `pageData`. It checks if `prev.children` is strictly the same as `newChildren` before updating the state, implying an effort to optimize performance for live data updates.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html`** (20/2/2026, 12:16:22):
    *   Updated the `title` meta tag to "3Cat, la plataforma digital de continguts en català i de qualitat".
    *   Changed the Shaka Player script source from `/public/libs/player/shaka-4-7-1.js` to `/libs/player/shaka.4.13.8.js`, indicating an upgrade or change in the Shaka Player library version.
    *   Removed commented-out `fetch.umd.js` script reference.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx`** (20/2/2026, 12:16:57):
    *   The timestamp aligns closely with the `index.html` change, suggesting a coordinated update.
    *   Includes a comprehensive setup for the main application, routing, context providers (Auth, Broadcast, History, Sitecatalyst, Capabilities, Options, Didomi, ParentalControl, Settings, Texts, Highlight, Virtualization), and modal management (ExitAppModal, ExtraAppModals).
    *   Initializes a dev console (`InitDevConsole`) with custom logging configurations (`ajsrConsole`).
    *   Includes a `BuildInfo` component to display various build and platform-specific debug information.
    *   `AppInner` component handles navigation, logout, and exit modal logic, including specific behavior for HbbTV platforms.
    *   The root `App` component sets up context providers and determines the overall application block structure.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js`** (20/2/2026, 13:13:26):
    *   Introduced functionality specific to Tizen OS.
    *   `initAppTizen` handles system info, visibility change events (pausing/playing video, navigating back on hide), and an `evExitApplication` event to gracefully exit the Tizen application.
    *   `initNetworkStateListener` sets up listeners for network connectivity changes.
    *   `hasTizenAppCommon` and `debugTizenAppCommon` functions were added for debugging Tizen's `appcommon` API.
    *   `initScreenSaverHelpers` manages screen saver enabling/disabling and updates its status in `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver`.
    *   `initExtraSamsungKeys` registers additional Samsung TV remote keys (Play, Pause, Fast Forward, Rewind, Color keys, numeric keys, Channel Up/Down).
    *   `launchAppTizen` and `openSamsungStore` functions were added to handle launching other Tizen applications and opening the Samsung App Store.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerLoader.jsx`** (20/2/2026, 18:52:39):
    *   Refactored ad tag URL handling. The previous method of stripping query parameters from `vmapUrl` was replaced with a new approach using `build3catVmapUrl` to replace macros with real values for dynamic ad targeting.
    *   Added `window.BufferingIndicator.show()` and `hide()` calls around the player initialization and cleanup.
    *   Integrated screen saver control: `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.disable()` on mount and `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.enable()` on unmount.
    *   Modified the `useEffect` dependency array for `getStreamData` cleanup from `[location]` to `[location, isStartOver]`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js`** (Numerous changes between 20/2/2026, 18:58:23 and 20/2/2026, 19:25:16):
    *   **Event Handling Refinements:** Multiple changes focused on `onKeyDownHandler`.
    *   The `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` calls were initially commented out, then `e.preventDefault()` was re-enabled, and later `e.stopPropagation()` was also re-enabled but within the `onKeyDownHandler`'s body, specifically after the platform-specific key handling. This indicates a fine-tuning of event propagation control to prevent default browser behavior for key presses while allowing certain events to propagate as needed for other platform logic.
    *   The file defines generic keyboard navigation for Smart TV platforms, including handling common keys (arrow keys, Enter, Back/Escape) and platform-specific keys for WebOS and Tizen (e.g., Play/Pause, Stop, Rewind, FastForward).
    *   Adds debug functionality to enable/disable ads via keys '1' and '2'.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss`** (23/2/2026, 12:40:42):
    *   Updated font declarations for "Bw 3Cat" and "Roboto". The "Bw 3Cat" font now includes both `.ttf` and `.woff` formats with various weights (Thin, Light, Regular, Medium, Bold, Heavy, Black, Dotted, Rounded).
    *   The `body` element's `font-family` was set to `"Bw 3Cat", sans-serif;`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx`** (23/2/2026, 17:26:19 - 23/2/2026, 17:27:28):
    *   Removed a `setInterval` call (`setInterval(() => { refresh_LOCAL_FavoritesList(); }, 3000);`) from the `useEffect` hook that runs on component mount. This suggests that the automatic refresh of the favorites list on an interval was removed, possibly in favor of more explicit or event-driven refreshes.
    *   The `refresh_LOCAL_FavoritesList()` is now called once on mount.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx`** (23/2/2026, 19:07:16):
    *   This component displays a live item in a home row, including image cropping, channel logos, progress bars, and external content indicators.
    *   It registers and unregisters focus actions for keyboard navigation.
    *   It uses `useExternalEmission` hook to determine external live status and associated text.
    *   The `navFixedFocusShape` is dynamically set based on whether the content is external.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Date Range:** The changes span from February 20th, 2026 to February 24th, 2026, indicating a focused period of development or bug fixing.
*   **React Component Focus:** A significant portion of the changes are within React components (`Page`, `App`, `PlayerLoader`, `BtnFavorite`, `LiveItemHome`), utilizing `useEffect`, `useState`, `useRef`, and `useMemo` hooks.
*   **Live Content Handling:** The `Page` component frequently deals with fetching, merging, and refreshing live content data (`ApiGetNowPlayingSelector`, `ApiGetNowPlaying`, `checkTimeFrame`, `refreshLives`). There's an ongoing effort to optimize how `pageData` is updated to avoid unnecessary re-renders when live content changes. The `live_refresh_interval` is a recurring point of modification.
*   **Platform Specificity:** The `App.jsx`, `tizen.js`, and `generic.js` files show a clear pattern of supporting different Smart TV platforms (Tizen, WebOS, HbbTV) with platform-specific initialization, event handling, and API calls. `window.AppGlobal.platform` is frequently checked.
*   **Keyboard Navigation and Focus Management:** Several files (`Page`, `App`, `generic.js`, `LiveItemHome`) demonstrate a robust focus management system (`nav.move.up()`, `nav.focusById()`, `data-group`, `data-nav-fixed-focus-shape`, `registerFocusAction`) critical for Smart TV applications. The `generic.js` file, in particular, centralizes common and platform-specific keyboard input handling.
*   **Context API Usage:** The `App.jsx` shows extensive use of React Context API for managing application-wide state (Auth, Options, Settings, Sitecatalyst, Capabilities, Highlight, Virtualization, Broadcast, History, Didomi, ParentalControl, Texts).
*   **Code Optimization/Refinement:** The iterative changes in `Page/index.jsx` regarding `setPageData` within `checkTimeFrame` illustrate an attempt to optimize performance by reducing unnecessary re-renders, although the implementation details fluctuate.
*   **Debugging/Development Utilities:** `ajsrConsole` and `BuildInfo` in `App.jsx`, along with debug logging in `tizen.js` and `generic.js`, indicate a focus on providing tools for debugging and monitoring the application's behavior and environment.
*   **Ad Integration:** `PlayerLoader.jsx` details the management of ad tag URLs, replacing macros for targeted advertising, suggesting an integrated ad monetization strategy.
*   **Font Management:** `fonts.scss` ensures consistent branding and typography by defining custom fonts across various weights and formats.

## 6:18:21
The provided log details changes across several files in the `3cat_smarttv` project, primarily focusing on a React component (`Page`), an HTML entry point, the main `App` component, a Tizen platform-specific JavaScript file, a player loader component, a generic platform utility, a favorite button component, and a font stylesheet.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (Frequent updates between 20/2/2026, 12:11:57 and 24/2/2026, 0:14:17):**
    *   This file, a React component named `Page`, underwent numerous modifications.
    *   **Initial change (20/2/2026, 12:11:57):** `live_refresh_interval` was hardcoded to `3000` but commented to suggest it could be `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`.
    *   **Subsequent change (20/2/2026, 12:12:08):** The `live_refresh_interval` was changed to `10000`, still commented out as `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`. This comment pattern persisted.
    *   **Further changes (23/2/2026 onwards):**
        *   The `live_refresh_interval` repeatedly switched between a hardcoded value (e.g., `3000`, `2000`, `1000`) and the commented-out `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`. This suggests ongoing testing or fine-tuning of the live content refresh rate.
        *   Modifications within the `checkTimeFrame` function were a recurring theme. Specifically, there were attempts to optimize state updates for `pageData`.
            *   One significant change involved commenting out `setPageData` and instead updating `homeDataRef.current` directly, then later setting `pageData` based on `homeDataRef.current` only if `hasRefreshed.current` was false (23/2/2026, 17:32:44). This indicates an effort to control re-renders and potentially avoid unnecessary UI updates during live data refreshes.
            *   Later, the `setPageData` call within `checkTimeFrame` was restored (23/2/2026, 19:01:47, 23:31:18, etc.) and then modified again to use a `prev` state comparison to prevent unnecessary re-renders if `children` arrays were identical (24/2/2026, 0:08:59).
        *   The `refreshLives` function consistently uses `setInterval` to periodically call itself and `checkTimeFrame`, marking `hasRefreshed.current = true`.
        *   The `useEffect` hook handling `onReset` events (for menu navigation or user changes) consistently clears `nowPlayingSelectorTimmerRef.current`, resets `hasRefreshed.current`, `homeDataRef.current`, and `nav.fixedFocus.isNavigating`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html` (20/2/2026, 12:16:22):**
    *   Updated meta tags for viewport (`user-scalable=0`).
    *   Added external JavaScript libraries: `underscore.js`, `visitorAPI.min.js`, `omniture.js`, `comscore.min.js`, `springstreams.min.js`, `shaka.4.13.8.js`, and `ima3.js`.
    *   Included a `purple-console.min.js` and `easy.qrcode.min.js` script.
    *   Added `div` elements for `splashScreen`, `playerContainer`, `cueContainer`, and `video-container` (containing a `video` and `ad-container`).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (20/2/2026, 12:16:57):**
    *   Introduced new imports for `UserType` and `ExtraAppModals`, `VideoSpinner`.
    *   Added a `BuildInfo` component to display various build and environment details, visible based on `window.appConfig.test_app` flags.
    *   The `InitDevConsole` function was defined to configure a custom console (`ajsrConsole`).
    *   The `AppInner` component now handles `openExitAppModal` and `openCloseSessionModal` actions, managing `ModalTypes.LOGOUT` and `ModalTypes.EXIT`. It also includes new debug components (`DebugConfigPane`, `DebugSessionSettingsPane`, `DebugModalsLauncher`).
    *   The `App` component added `BrowserRouter` with `v7_startTransition` and `v7_relativeSplatPath` future flags.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (20/2/2026, 13:13:26):**
    *   Enhanced Tizen platform integration.
    *   `initAppTizen`: Added `tizen.systeminfo.getPropertyValue('BUILD')` for device info and `document.addEventListener('visibilitychange')` to pause/play the player and handle `evExitApplication` for app exit.
    *   `initNetworkStateListener`: Added a network state change listener to dispatch `evNetworkDisconnected` and `evNetworkConnected` events.
    *   `hasTizenAppCommon` and `debugTizenAppCommon` functions were introduced or updated for checking/debugging `webapis.appcommon` features.
    *   `initScreenSaverHelpers`: Introduced functions to `enableScreenSaver` and `disableScreenSaver` using `webapis.appcommon.setScreenSaver`, updating `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.status`.
    *   `initExtraSamsungKeys`: Registered additional Samsung TV Remote keys (Play/Pause, FF/RW, color keys, numeric keys, channel up/down).
    *   `launchAppTizen` and `openSamsungStore` functions were added for launching other Tizen apps or opening the Samsung store.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerLoader.jsx` (20/2/2026, 18:52:39):**
    *   Expanded player functionality and integration.
    *   New imports for `ApiRelated`, `ApiGetLiveExtraParams`, `ApiGetNowPlaying`, `getLogoImage`, and several utility functions related to stream types and data handling (`dataHandler`, `dataHandler_stov`, `dataHandler_nowListening`).
    *   Added `GeoRestrictionPlayerModal` and `build3catVmapUrl`, `getVmapParamsPlatform` for ads.
    *   Introduced states for `currentProgramData`, `currentLiveData`, `startOverData`, `programLogoImage`, `isStartOver`, and `nowListeningData`.
    *   Implemented `setSubtitlesStyles` and `removeSubtitlesStyles` for dynamic subtitle styling based on user options.
    *   The `getStreamData` function now handles fetching related content, live extra parameters, and integrates with ads by constructing `vmapUrl` using `build3catVmapUrl`. It also manages `time_markers` for credits and autoplay.
    *   `loadNowPlayingData` was added to fetch and update "now listening" information for audio streams.
    *   `useEffect` hooks were introduced to manage screen saver state (disable on player load, enable on cleanup) and buffering indicator visibility.
    *   The player initialization (`PlayerController`) now takes `currentProgramData`, `streamData`, `settingsData`, `capabilities`, `optionsProvider`, `sitecatalyst`, `streamType.current`, and `isAuthenticated`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (Multiple updates between 20/2/2026, 18:58:23 and 20/2/2026, 19:25:16):**
    *   **Focus Management:** The `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartTV` function manages keyboard input for Smart TVs.
    *   **Key Handling:** The `onKeyDownHandler` function was present throughout, with varying `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` calls.
        *   **Initial state (20/2/2026, 18:58:23):** `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` were commented out.
        *   **Intermediate state (20/2/2026, 19:05:58):** Both `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` were uncommented and active. This change suggests an intent to strictly control default browser/platform key handling behavior.
        *   **Later state (20/2/2026, 19:15:17):** `e.stopPropagation()` was commented out, while `e.preventDefault()` remained active. This indicates a refinement to prevent default actions but allow event propagation for other listeners.
        *   **Final observed state (20/2/2026, 19:21:43 and 19:25:16):** `e.stopPropagation()` was moved to the end of the `onKeyDownHandler` function, affecting event flow after custom key handling.
    *   **Player Key Integration:** The `PLAYER_KEYS` set and corresponding logic to ignore player keys if the player is not ready remained consistent.
    *   **Debug Keys:** Numeric keys `1`, `2`, `3` were assigned debug actions (e.g., enable/disable ads, display build number).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss` (23/2/2026, 12:40:42):**
    *   Extended font definitions.
    *   Added a variety of "Bw 3Cat" font weights (Black, Bold, Dotted, Heavy, Light, Medium, Regular, Rounded, Thin) from `.ttf` and `.woff` sources.
    *   Added "Roboto" font weights (Black, Bold, Light, Medium, Regular, Thin) from `.ttf` sources.
    *   Set `body` `font-family` to `"Bw 3Cat", sans-serif;`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 17:26:19 and 17:27:28):**
    *   This component manages "add to favorites" and "remove from favorites" actions.
    *   **Initial change (23/2/2026, 17:26:19):** An `setInterval` was added in a `useEffect` to call `refresh_LOCAL_FavoritesList()` every 3 seconds.
    *   **Subsequent change (23/2/2026, 17:27:28):** The `setInterval` call was removed from `useEffect`, and `refresh_LOCAL_FavoritesList()` was called directly once on component mount. This suggests a change in how frequently the local favorite status needs to be checked.
    *   The logic for adding/removing favorites (`ApiSetFavorite`, `ApiRemoveFavorite`) and updating `FavoritesMemory` remained consistent.
    *   The `setIsFavorite(false)` call at the end of `refreshLocalFavoritesAction` remained, which seems potentially incorrect as it would immediately mark the item as not favorite after an action, regardless of success.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 19:07:16):**
    *   Introduced new imports for `useExternalEmission` hook and `icLinkExterior` SVG.
    *   The `LiveItemHome` component now supports displaying external content information, including a `platform-footer` with a `platform-logo` and `platform-icon` (link exterior).
    *   Conditional rendering for "EN DIRECTE" (live) and "UPCOMING" tags based on `isLiveExternal` and `whiteTagText` from `useExternalEmission`.
    *   The `navFixedFocusShape` was dynamically set to `keyframe external-content` if `isExternal` is true.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **20/2/2026, 12:11:57 - 12:12:08:** Initial changes to `Page` component, particularly `live_refresh_interval` adjustment.

*   **23/2/2026, 17:26:19 - 17:27:28:** Refinement of favorite list refreshing logic in `btnFavoriteMemory/index.jsx`.
*   **23/2/2026, 17:31:09 - 24/2/2026, 0:14:17:** Multiple, frequent small changes in `page/index.jsx` primarily focused on `checkTimeFrame` logic and `setPageData` calls, suggesting an iterative debugging/optimization process for live data rendering.
*   **23/2/2026, 19:07:16:** Introduction of external content support and related UI elements in `liveItemHome/index.jsx`.
*   **23/2/2026, 19:09:03:** A notable change in `page/index.jsx` to optimize re-renders by only updating live rows if `pageData` is already present, avoiding a full re-render on subsequent live data updates.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Refinement and Optimization:** Many changes, especially in `page/index.jsx` and `generic.js`, show a pattern of iterative refinement. This includes adjusting refresh intervals, optimizing state updates to prevent unnecessary re-renders, and fine-tuning event propagation for keyboard inputs.
*   **Platform-Specific Adaptations:** There's a clear focus on adapting the application for different Smart TV platforms (Tizen, WebOS, HbbTV), particularly evident in `tizen.js` and `generic.js` with platform-specific key code handling and API integrations.
*   **Context and Global State Management:** The frequent use of React Contexts (e.g., `AuthContext`, `OptionsContext`, `SettingsContext`, `SitecatalystContext`, `CapabilitiesContext`, `HighlightContext`, `VirtualizationContext`) indicates a robust architecture for managing application-wide state and capabilities. The `window.AppGlobal` object is also heavily used for global state and actions.
*   **Live Content Handling:** The `Page` component prominently features complex logic (`checkTimeFrame`, `mergeData`, `refreshLives`, `nowPlayingSelectorTimmerRef`) for dynamically updating and displaying live content and "now playing" information, indicating that this is a core and frequently adjusted feature.
*   **User Experience Enhancements:** Changes related to subtitle styling, screen saver management, and debug tools suggest efforts to improve both the user experience and developer debugging capabilities.
*   **Modularity:** The project leverages a component-based structure (e.g., `GenericRow`, `SliderRow`, `RoundRow`, `PageHead`, `UserModal`, `Spinner`, various modals), promoting code reusability and maintainability.
*   **Ad Integration:** The `playerLoader.jsx` changes explicitly mention ad integration, including `vmapUrl` construction and enabling/disabling ads, indicating a commercial aspect of the application.
