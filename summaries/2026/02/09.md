# Activity Summary for 9/2/2026

## 1:41:11
This log details a series of code changes, primarily for a `3cat_smarttv` application, over several days in February 2026, alongside updates to a `gateway` component. The modifications broadly focus on UI rendering, user experience, platform compatibility, and core application logic.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\3cat_pro\gateway\js\app.js` (2/2/2026, 14:16:27):**
    *   Initializes connection managers (WebOS, Palm) and a remote website URL based on the device's SDK version.
    *   Redirects to a specific URL if an internet connection is available; otherwise, it displays an alert and subscribes to network status changes to redirect once connectivity is restored. Includes basic back button handling.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx` (2/2/2026, 16:31:34):**
    *   Significantly refactored the media information display component.
    *   Enhanced logic for `EpisodeCount` and `SeasonsCount` components, incorporating `LIVE_REFRESH_INTERVAL` from settings.
    *   A "Publication" feature was commented out (JIRA CCMA-2104).
    *   Improved conditional display and formatting for "Available until" dates.
    *   Refined the selection logic for `title`, `description`, `logoImage`, and `channelLogo` to prioritize `default_episode` and handle diverse content types (live, audio, link collections).
    *   Added conditional filtering for `item.rating_tags` and updated logic for `shouldShowProgramTitle`/`shouldShowEpisodeTitle`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\mediaTitle\styles.scss` (2/2/2026, 16:33:36):**
    *   Introduced comprehensive styling for `mediaTitle` elements, including font properties, text shadows, and `max-width`.
    *   Defined specific styles for different contexts like `title_program`, `live`, `stream`, `menu_detail`, and `external` titles, adjusting font weights and sizes.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\portraitItem\styles.scss` (2/2/2026, 16:39:57):**
    *   Added detailed styling for portrait-oriented items within rows.
    *   Includes distinct visual feedback for focused states (`.focused`) with `box-shadow` and `outline`.
    *   Styled `.tag` elements and a `.platform-logo` section for external branding within these items.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\keyboard\styles.scss` (2/2/2026, 16:56:08 & 17:09:25):**
    *   Established styling for a virtual keyboard, including layout, key dimensions, colors, and font.
    *   Specific styles were added for different key sizes (`SMALL`, `MEDIUM`, `LARGE`) and icons for common actions (backspace, space, return).
    *   The `:hover` style for keyboard keys was activated in a subsequent commit.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (2/2/2026, 17:08:44 & 5/2/2026, 13:32:40):**
    *   Implemented a `KeyMemory` system to track key combinations and trigger associated actions (e.g., enabling/disabling player ads).
    *   Expanded the `onKeyDownHandler` to include specific key codes for various Smart TV platforms (Samsung Tizen, LG WebOS, Hisense) for back/exit functionality, routing to `openExitAppModal`.
    *   Player control keys (Play, Pause, Stop, Rewind, Fast Forward) were added with platform-specific handling, though the throttle mechanism and dispatch events for fast forward/rewind were later commented out.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\index.jsx` (2/2/2026, 17:36:09 & 17:36:22):**
    *   Extensively developed the side menu component for navigation and user interaction.
    *   It dynamically generates first-level (L1) and second-level (L2) menu options based on the active user type (standard or kid).
    *   Integrated a global search option into the menu.
    *   Introduced sophisticated focus management for menu navigation, including storing and restoring the last focused element.
    *   Updated logic for changing users and exiting the application, providing appropriate navigation paths.
    *   A minor change involved setting `window.__isEntry` within a `useEffect` hook.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\onboarding\usersScreen\index.jsx` (2/2/2026, 17:45:11 - 18:14:59):**
    *   This user selection screen component underwent a series of rapid, iterative changes.
    *   Initially displayed logged-in users, a "Super3" (kid profile) option, and an "Add User" button.
    *   The handling of `window.__isEntry` (determining if it's an initial entry point) was frequently modified, toggling between deriving from `location.state`, being hardcoded `true`, or being entirely commented out, ultimately introducing a `window.__foceEntry` global variable for explicit control.
    *   The `exitKidMode()` call in a `useEffect` was temporarily commented out then restored.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\utils\goBackHistory.js` (2/2/2026, 18:15:16):**
    *   Modified the `goBackHistory` utility to integrate `window.__isEntry` and `window.__foceEntry` flags when deciding to execute a callback (e.g., open exit modal) or navigate back in history.
    *   Added specific logic to handle media player states (e.g., hiding audio/subtitle menus) before navigating back.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (2/2/2026, 18:50:50 - 19:14:36):**

    *   Establishes React Router for navigation and provides numerous context providers (Auth, Settings, etc.) to the application tree.
    *   Includes debug utilities (console, build info).
    *   `AppInner` component manages the main application routes (public and private) and central modal handling (exit, logout).
    *   The `openExitAppModal` function's behavior was temporarily altered, disengaging the modal display and focus storage, but later restored to its original functionality.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\tizen\3cat_pro\config.xml` (3/2/2026, 13:24:24 & 5/2/2026, 10:47:12 & 11:41:17):**
    *   Initial setup of the Tizen configuration file with various features, metadata (e.g., `devel.api.version="8.0"`), and privileges.
    *   The application `id` and `package` attributes were updated from `http://tizen.tv3.ccma.cat.qa` to `http://tizen.qa.ccma.cat` and `PzkKxRdFT6.TV3.qa` to `PzkKxRdFT6qa.TV3`, respectively, likely for deployment environment differentiation.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx` (4/2/2026, 11:36:24 - 14:01:29):**
    *   This component, rendering circular media items, saw extensive changes related to visual presentation for different user types.
    *   It dynamically selects images based on formats like `'round'`, `'logo'`, and `'big-round'`.
    *   Introduced and frequently adjusted logic using `isKidsProfile` and `isBigRound` props to determine image format and styling.
    *   Updated the `data-nav-fixed-focus-shape` attribute to dynamically set focus shapes (e.g., `'bigRound'`) for improved navigation feedback.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.scss` (4/2/2026, 13:53:09):**
    *   Updated the base `.roundElement` styles, adjusting dimensions, borders, and text properties.
    *   Introduced specific styles for `.biground_row .roundElement` to provide distinct sizing for "big round" items.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.kids.scss` (4/2/2026, 12:22:36 - 14:12:14):**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\rowUtils.js` (4/2/2026, 12:01:27 & 12:01:36):**
    *   A minor but functional correction in `getRowkind` changed `square-mini` to `square_mini` when identifying `ROUND` row types.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (4/2/2026, 12:02:26 - 13:22:28):**
    *   The generic row component was updated to recognize and render `SQUARE_MINI` items.
    *   Temporarily included a `roundItemTitle` for `isKidsProfile` items within this component, which was later removed.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\styles.scss` (4/2/2026, 12:48:42):**
    *   Adjusted dimensions and layout for various `generic_row` types and the "show all" item, including positioning for `plus-icon` and hover/focus styles.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\index.jsx` (4/2/2026, 12:27:53 - 13:42:39):**
    *   This component for rendering rows of round items evolved significantly.
    *   It initially handled `isKidsProfile` for `textAlign` and prop passing, which was then replaced by `isBigRound`.
    *   Introduced conditional application of `biground_row` class and `roundItemTitle` rendering based on `isBigRound`.
    *   The import of `styles.kids.scss` was added and removed in several commits.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\styles.scss` (4/2/2026, 13:40:37):**
    *   Introduced distinct `height` values for `round_row` and `biground_row`.
    *   Combined common styling for both row types and explicitly defined styles for `.roundItemTitle`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (4/2/2026, 13:25:55 - 13:34:44):**
    *   Received its initial, extensive implementation. This component is central to rendering content pages.
    *   It handles data fetching for home and other pages, dynamically refreshing live content, and managing user authentication.
    *   Includes sophisticated row filtering logic based on platform capabilities (live/Shaka player support, HbbTV external content restrictions) and user profiles (disabling `user_row` for kid mode).
    *   Integrates multiple contexts (Auth, Settings, etc.) and renders various row types (Slider, Round, Generic).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.scss` (4/2/2026, 12:26:49 - 14:26:32):**
    *   This file defines visual styles for the focus indicator.
    *   Introduced a new `bigRound` focus shape with specific dimensions and styling.
    *   Adjusted `box-shadow` and `border` colors for `bigRound` (transitioning from `light-purple` to `kid-white`) with `!important` to ensure override.
    *   Refined positioning for `round` and `bigRound` focus shapes within page contexts.
    *   Experienced multiple temporary changes and reversions related to `outline` and `border` properties, indicating a fine-tuning process.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.kids.scss` (4/2/2026, 12:26:49 - 14:14:40):**
    *   Provides specific overrides for focus styles in "kid mode."
    *   Consistently applies `$base-color-3cat-kid-light-purple` for `box-shadow` and `border-color`.
    *   Added rules for `&.round` and `&.bigRound` to explicitly set `outline: 0px;` within kid mode.
    *   Also saw temporary changes and reversions of `outline` and `border` properties.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.kids.scss` (4/2/2026, 14:18:09):**
    *   Newly created stylesheet that defines general kid-mode specific focus styles, applying a `kid-light-purple` color for `box-shadow`, `border-color`, and `outline` to focused elements in scrollable containers.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\index.jsx` (4/2/2026, 15:12:08 - 15:17:01):**
    *   Initial implementation for a modal displaying external content information.
    *   Shows item details, promo text, platform info, and "open external" and "continue in app" buttons.
    *   Conditionally applies a `partner` class to the layout and adjusts image height based on the `item.collection` type.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss` (4/2/2026, 15:15:02):**
    *   Established the visual layout for the external content modal, utilizing flexbox, defining backgrounds, shadows, padding, and specific sizing and positioning for internal elements.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\libs\img.js` (5/2/2026, 9:38:25 - 9:46:57):**
    *   Provided image utility functions, including `getImgProxyUrl` and `getBestImage`/`getBestImageV2` for optimized image selection.
    *   The `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` array was corrected to remove a duplicate `round` entry.
    *   There was an iterative process of adding and removing `'square-round'` and `'big-round'` formats to a `notAllowedFomats` array within `getBestImageV2` based on desired aspect ratios (LANDSCAPE/PORTRAIT), indicating fine-tuning of image filtering logic.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

The changes are concentrated between February 2nd and February 5th, 2026. Key milestones include:
*   **February 2nd, afternoon:** Initial setup and core logic for the gateway and fundamental Smart TV UI components like `mediaInfo`, `mediaTitle`, `portraitItem` styles, `keyboard` styles, and the `generic.js` platform handler. The `sideMenu` and `App.jsx` received their comprehensive initial implementations, along with the first version of the `usersScreen`.
*   **February 4th, morning/early afternoon:** Intensive development on row item components, particularly `roundItem` and `roundRow`, with frequent iterations on kid-mode specific styling and image selection. The `genericRow` component was also introduced, and the main `page` component for content rendering was first implemented. Significant work on `fixedFocus.scss` and `fixedFocus.kids.scss` to refine focus visual feedback.
*   **February 4th, afternoon:** Implementation of the `externalContentModal` and its associated styles.
*   **February 5th, morning:** Refinements to image utility functions in `img.js` and updates to the Tizen platform's `config.xml` to adjust application IDs. Minor adjustments to `platform/generic.js` for key event handling.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Kid Mode Development:** A strong and consistent theme is the progressive integration and styling of a "kid mode." This is evident through:
    *   Conditional logic in components like `sideMenu`, `page`, and `usersScreen` based on `UserType.KID` or `isKidsProfile`.
    *   The creation and frequent updates of dedicated SCSS files (`styles.kids.scss`) for `roundItem`, `fixedFocus`, and the global `App` styles, specifically targeting kid-friendly aesthetics (e.g., bright purple focus colors).
    *   Dynamic image selection in `roundItem` based on `isKidsProfile` or `isBigRound`.
2.  **UI Focus and Navigation:** Significant effort is dedicated to precise control over UI focus and navigation across various platforms:
    *   Extensive use of `registerFocusAction` and `unregisterFocusAction` in interactive components.
    *   The `data-nav-fixed-focus-shape` attribute is used to define distinct focus indicator shapes (`round`, `bigRound`, `poster`, `square`).
    *   Numerous, often iterative, changes in `fixedFocus.scss` and `fixedFocus.kids.scss` to fine-tune the visual appearance and behavior of the focus highlight.
    *   Centralized management of global focus state through `nav.storedFocus` and `nav.fixedFocus.isNavigating`.
3.  **Platform-Specific Adaptations:** The codebase shows clear patterns for handling different Smart TV environments:
    *   Dynamic service selection (WebOS vs. Palm) in the gateway.
    *   Platform-specific key code handling and player controls in `platform/generic.js` for WebOS, Tizen, and HbbTV.
    *   Content filtering in `page/index.jsx` based on `window.AppGlobal.platform` (e.g., HbbTV restrictions) and feature support (`isLiveSupported`, `isShakaPlayerSupported`).
    *   Dedicated Tizen `config.xml` for build configuration.
4.  **Iterative Refinement and Experimentation:** Many files, particularly the SCSS files (`fixedFocus.scss`, `fixedFocus.kids.scss`) and `usersScreen\index.jsx`, exhibit multiple commits with small changes, quick reverts, and re-implementations of code blocks. This suggests an active development workflow involving rapid prototyping, testing, and continuous adjustment of UI/UX and core logic.
5.  **Global Application State:** The consistent use of `window.AppGlobal` to expose actions, states, and utilities (e.g., `window.AppGlobal.Actions.openExitAppModal`, `window.AppGlobal.KeyMemory`, `window.__isEntry`, `window.__foceEntry`) indicates a reliance on global variables for cross-component communication and application-wide settings.

## 6:42:00
The provided log shows a series of code changes, primarily focusing on a "3cat_smarttv" project, with a few modifications to a "gateway" project. The changes span from February 2nd, 2026, to February 5th, 2026.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\3cat_pro\gateway\js\app.js`** (2/2/2026, 14:16:27):
    *   The `init` function was modified to dynamically determine the `connectionmanager` service (WebOS or Palm) based on the device's `sdkVersion`.
    *   The `REMOTE` URL for the application changes from `https://smartv-dev.3cat.website/` to `https://smartv-pro.3cat.website/` if the SDK version is between 300 and 350.
    *   Includes logic to check internet connection, and if unavailable, displays an alert and subscribes to network status changes to redirect when a connection is restored.
    *   Introduces handling for the `VK_BACK` key for platform navigation.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx`** (2/2/2026, 16:31:34):
    *   Extensive changes related to displaying media information, including episode/season counts, expiration dates, and live/upcoming event indicators.
    *   Introduced `EpisodeCount` and `SeasonsCount` components with logic for rendering based on `episode_count` and `seasons_count`.
    *   Commented out `Publication` component and related code, explicitly stating `// JIRA CCMA-2104: Eliminamos funcionalidad 'A partir del'`. This indicates a removal of "available from" date functionality.
    *   Updated logic for determining and displaying `title` and `description` for various media types (live, audio, thematic, regular titles, external content).
    *   Added `shouldShowProgramTitle` and `shouldShowEpisodeTitle` memos for conditional rendering.
    *   Implemented `showExpiration` logic to display "Disponible fins a l'" or "Disponible fins al " with a formatted date if `unpublished_on` is within 3 months.
    *   Integrated `useExternalEmission` hook for handling external live content and displaying white tags.
    *   Added new JSX for rendering external platform logos and various `MediaTag` types (live, white, date-based).
    *   Adjusted logo image rendering for live streams.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\mediaTitle\styles.scss`** (2/2/2026, 16:33:36):
    *   Updated styling for `.mediaTitle`, specifically adding different font weights and sizes for `.title_program`, `.live`, `.isLive_or_upcoming_event`, `.stream`, and `.menu_detail` classes. Increased default font size to 56px.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\portraitItem\styles.scss`** (2/2/2026, 16:39:57):
    *   Modified styles for `.portraitItem`, including:
        *   Updated focused state `box-shadow` and `outline` color to `$base-color-3cat-red`.
        *   Adjusted `tag` styles with a white background, black text, and specific positioning/sizing.
        *   Added styles for `.platform-logo` and `.externalLogo`/`.externalIcon` for displaying external platform branding.
        *   Updated hover and focused states for better visual feedback.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\keyboard\styles.scss`** (2/2/2026, 16:56:08 and 2/2/2026, 17:09:25):
    *   Initial changes define the overall `.keyboard` layout and individual `.keyboard-key` styles, including specific sizes for `SMALL`, `MEDIUM`, `LARGE` keys, and background images for `BACKSPACE`, `SPACE_BAR`, `RETURN` icons.
    *   The second change (`17:09:25`) introduces a `:hover` style for `.keyboard-key` to match the `.focused` state, providing consistent visual feedback on hover and focus.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js`** (2/2/2026, 17:08:44 and 5/2/2026, 13:32:40):
    *   Initial version includes a `THROTTLE_MS` of 200ms to prevent rapid key presses. It defines common and platform-specific key handling for navigation (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, ENTER, BACK) and player actions (PLAY, PAUSE, STOP, FF, REWIND).
    *   Includes a `KeyMemory` object to handle key combinations, particularly for enabling/disabling ads with specific sequences (e.g., "979899" for "123" browser, "451451451" for Play button on WebOS/Tizen).
    *   The later change (`5/2/2026, 13:32:40`) comments out the `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` from the `onKeyDownHandler` and removes the `THROTTLE_MS` check (by commenting out `if (now - lastTs < THROTTLE_MS) return;`). This could imply a change in key event handling or a desire for more immediate response.
    *   It also comments out the `dispatchRewindEvent()` and `dispatchFastForwardEvent()` calls within the platform-specific sections and removes their function definitions at the end of the file, indicating a deprecation or removal of these specific event dispatches from the generic key handler.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\index.jsx`** (2/2/2026, 17:36:09 and 2/2/2026, 17:36:22):
    *   Both timestamps show nearly identical extensive React component logic for a side menu.
    *   Initializes `window.AppMenu.vars` for menu state.
    *   Manages L1 (main) and L2 (sub) menu data and visibility states.
    *   Attaches a 'Search' option to the beginning of L1 menu data.
    *   Includes functions for opening/closing menu levels, exiting the menu, and handling navigation based on user authentication (kid/adult profiles).
    *   `refreshSelectedOption` logic for updating `selL1` and `selL2` based on the current `location.pathname`.
    *   The only visible difference is `window.__isEntry = isMenuVisible;` being added in the first `useEffect` hook in the `17:36:22` version.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\onboarding\usersScreen\index.jsx`** (Multiple timestamps between 2/2/2026, 17:45:11 and 2/2/2026, 18:14:59):
    *   This file sees frequent minor changes, primarily related to how `window.__isEntry` is managed for determining if the user screen is an entry point.
    *   Initially `window.__isEntry = location.state?.isEntry || false;`.
    *   Then, it's briefly changed to `window.__isEntry = true;` (2/2/2026, 18:05:33).
    *   Then, `window.__isEntry` is entirely commented out (`/*const location = useLocation(); window.__isEntry = location.state?.isEntry || false;*/`) and later re-added as `window.__isEntry = true;` inside a `useEffect` hook, which is then commented out again in favor of a new `useEffect` hook that sets `window.__foceEntry = true;` on mount and `false` on unmount (`2/2/2026, 18:14:59`). This indicates an iterative process of debugging and refining the logic for determining the app's entry state for navigation and back button handling.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\utils\goBackHistory.js`** (2/2/2026, 18:15:16):
    *   The `goBackHistory` function's condition for calling `callBackFunc()` (which likely opens the exit app modal) was expanded to include `window.__isEntry` and `window.__foceEntry`. This directly relates to the changes in `usersScreen/index.jsx` to ensure proper exit behavior from the entry screens.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx`** (Multiple timestamps between 2/2/2026, 18:50:50 and 2/2/2026, 19:14:36):
    *   This file defines the main application structure, routing, and context providers.
    *   Multiple minor edits occur across these timestamps, mainly in the `openExitAppModal` function.
    *   Specifically, `window.isUserModalVisible = true; nav.storedFocus = nav.getCurrentId(); setExitModal(ModalTypes.EXIT);` within `openExitAppModal` is temporarily commented out and then re-enabled, suggesting a debugging or testing phase for modal visibility and focus management.
    *   Also, `window.AppMenu.manageFocused?.();` is briefly added to `openExitAppModal` and then removed, indicating experimentation with menu focus behavior when opening an exit modal.
    *   The file includes debug configurations for `BuildInfo`, `DebugConfigPane`, `DebugSessionSettingsPane`, and `DebugModalsLauncher`, showing an active development environment.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\tizen\3cat_pro\config.xml`** (3/2/2026, 13:24:24, 5/2/2026, 10:47:12, and 5/2/2026, 11:41:17):
    *   The `id` attribute of the `<widget>` element was changed from `http://tizen.tv3.ccma.cat.qa` to `http://tizen.qa.ccma.cat`.
    *   Similarly, the `id` of the `<tizen:application>` element changed from `PzkKxRdFT6.TV3.qa` to `PzkKxRdFT6qa.TV3`.
    *   The `package` attribute for the Tizen application changed from `PzkKxRdFT6qa` to `PzkKxRdFT6qa` (no change visible in provided log for package, but often goes with id changes).
    *   These changes indicate an update to the application's unique identifiers, likely for a different QA or deployment environment.
    *   The `use.preview` metadata value `endpoint_URL` points to `https://pro.3cat.website/api/rss/v1/discovery-feed/smarthub`.
    *   The last two timestamps show identical content, implying no further changes after the one at `10:47:12`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx`** (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 11:36:24 and 4/2/2026, 14:01:29):
    *   Initially includes `isKidsProfile` logic in `useMemo` to find `round` images for kids or standard `round`/`logo` images otherwise.
    *   Introduced `isBigRound` prop, which influences image format selection (`big-round` vs `round`) and the `data-nav-fixed-focus-shape` attribute (`bigRound` vs `round`).
    *   The `isKidsProfile` condition was temporarily removed from the `useMemo` for image selection (`4/2/2026, 12:21:39`) and then later replaced by `isBigRound` as the determinant (`4/2/2026, 13:44:59` and onwards).
    *   The `type` used for styling (e.g., `round-image`) also adapts to `isBigRound` instead of `isKidsProfile`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.scss`** (4/2/2026, 13:53:09):
    *   Added specific styles for `.biground_row .roundElement`, adjusting width, height, and margin to accommodate larger round items.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.kids.scss`** (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:22:36 and 4/2/2026, 13:54:47):
    *   Initially defines a background color and border for `.roundElement` in `.kid-mode`.
    *   Changes involve adding and removing border styles, suggesting refinement of the visual focus and general appearance of round items in kid mode. The final state at `13:54:47` retains a purple background and border.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\rowUtils.js`** (4/2/2026, 12:01:27 and 4/2/2026, 12:01:36):
    *   Fixed a typo: `square-mini` was changed to `square_mini` when determining `ROWKIND` for 'ROUND' rows.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx`** (4/2/2026, 12:02:26, 4/2/2026, 12:49:54, and 4/2/2026, 12:54:35):
    *   Updated `getRowElement` and `getShowAllElementsFocusShape` to explicitly include `SQUARE_MINI` as a row type that returns `SquareItem` and has a 'square' focus shape.
    *   A `div` with class `roundItemTitle` and displaying `item.title` was added at the end of the component's render function, conditional on `isKidsProfile`. This was then removed in the last change, implying that `roundItemTitle` is now handled differently or only within specific `RoundRow` contexts.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\styles.scss`** (4/2/2026, 12:48:42):
    *   Added new style blocks for `.rowType_SQUARE_MINI` to define its specific height and the styling for its `.roundItemTitle`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\index.jsx`** (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:27:53 and 4/2/2026, 13:42:39, and 4/2/2026, 12:56:05 and 4/2/2026, 12:57:05):
    *   Initial version (12:27:53) included `isKidsProfile` prop, which influenced `textAlign` of `roundItemWrapper`.
    *   This `isKidsProfile` prop was removed from `RoundRow` and `RoundItem` props, and the `textAlign` style was hardcoded to `left` (`4/2/2026, 12:56:05` and `4/2/2026, 12:57:05`). This suggests `isKidsProfile` styling is handled at a higher level or through global classes.
    *   The `isBigRound` prop was introduced, affecting the root `div` class (`biground_row` vs `round_row`) and `textAlign` of `roundItemWrapper`.
    *   A `div` for `roundItemTitle` was added conditionally based on `isBigRound`, displaying `item.title`. This correlates with its removal from `GenericRow`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\styles.scss`** (4/2/2026, 12:28:04 and 4/2/2026, 13:40:37):
    *   Initially defines height for `.round_row`.
    *   The later change adds styles for `.biground_row` and combines common styles for both `.round_row` and `.biground_row`, explicitly setting different heights for each. Also added `roundItemTitle` styles.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\styles.kids.scss`** (4/2/2026, 12:30:18):
    *   Temporarily commented out height adjustment for `.round_row` in kid mode.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.scss`** (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 14:02:04 and 4/2/2026, 14:26:32):
    *   Introduced a `.bigRound` class with specific `width`, `height`, `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, and `border` styles, intended for larger round focus elements.
    *   The border and box-shadow colors for `.bigRound` were initially `light-purple` (likely a kid-mode color) and then explicitly changed to `red` (main theme) and then back to `white` with `!important` at `14:26:06` and `14:26:27`. This indicates careful tuning of focus styles for different themes/contexts.
    *   Updated the `.page` context for fixed focus to apply to both `.round` and `.bigRound` elements.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.kids.scss`** (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:26:49 and 4/2/2026, 14:14:40):
    *   Focus styles for `.fixed-focus .inner` within `.kid-mode` were heavily adjusted.
    *   Initially, `.round` specific styles were commented out and then re-added, then removed again.
    *   General `.inner` styles were frequently modified regarding `box-shadow`, `border-color`, and `outline` color to use kid-specific purple colors.
    *   The final changes enable `outline: 0px;` for `.round` and `.bigRound` elements within `.kid-mode`, indicating these specific shapes might have their focus handled differently or rely solely on box-shadow.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.kids.scss`** (4/2/2026, 14:18:09):
    *   Added focus styles for `.V-SCROLLABLE:not(.fixed) .focused` in `.kid-mode` to use kid-specific purple colors, indicating a global focus style for kid mode.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx`** (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 13:25:55 and 4/2/2026, 13:34:44):
    *   Maintains logic for fetching home/page data, refreshing live streams, and handling navigation.
    *   The `filterChildren` function now explicitly filters `user_row` items when the `activeUser?.type` is `UserType.KID`. This ensures that "user row" content is not displayed in kid mode.
    *   No significant functional changes between these timestamps, mostly identical code entries.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\index.jsx`** (4/2/2026, 15:12:08 and 4/2/2026, 15:17:01):
    *   Modified the `generateImageData` call to dynamically set the `height` based on whether `item.collection === 'partner'` (428px for partners, 544px otherwise), and passed `isPartner` as a dependency to the `useMemo` hook.
    *   The `popupLeft` div now dynamically applies a `partner` class if `isPartner` is true, indicating a visual distinction for partner content.
    *   The condition for rendering `platformLogoContainer` changed to `!isPartner && item.external_content_data?.platform_image`, meaning it's only shown for non-partner external content.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss`** (4/2/2026, 15:15:02):
    *   Added styles for `.popupLeft.partner` to set a specific height for partner external content.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\libs\img.js`** (Multiple timestamps between 5/2/2026, 9:38:25 and 5/2/2026, 9:46:57):
    *   The `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` array was frequently modified, primarily removing and re-adding `'round'` and adding `'square-round'` or `'big-round'`.
    *   The `getBestImageV2` function's `notAllowedFomats` array was modified to include `'square-round'` and `'big-round'` when `desiredAspect` is `LANDSCAPE`. This indicates a refinement in how images are selected based on aspect ratio and specific formats, especially for "round" and "square-round" images.
    *   Removed `console.log` statements related to `LiveItemHome` in `generateImageDataFromLiveChannelInHome_v2` for cleaner code.
    *   The duplicates of "round" in `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` were removed (`5/2/2026, 9:40:33`), and then "big-round" was added to the `notAllowedFomats` for landscape aspect ratio in `getBestImageV2` (`5/2/2026, 9:44:04`).

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Timestamp Consistency**: All changes occur on February 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th, 2026, suggesting an active development sprint or intensive bug-fixing period.
*   **Kid Mode / User Type Specificity**: There's a strong recurring pattern of adding or refining logic and styles specifically for "Kid Mode" or different `UserType`s. This includes:
    *   Conditional rendering of menu data (`SideMenu`).
    *   Filtering of content rows (`Page`).
    *   Specific image formats (`RoundItem`).
    *   Distinct focus styles and background colors (`fixedFocus.kids.scss`, `roundItem/styles.kids.scss`, `App.kids.scss`).
    *   This indicates a significant effort to tailor the user experience based on the active user profile (adult vs. kid).
*   **Focus Management and Navigation**: Many changes revolve around handling focus (`nav.focusById`, `registerFocusAction`, `unregisterFocusAction`) and navigation, especially for Smart TV platforms (keyboard input, `goBackHistory`, menu interactions). There's also `data-block-focus-*` and `data-on-lost-*` attributes used for detailed navigation control.
*   **Image Handling and Optimization**: Several updates in `src\libs\img.js` and components (`RoundItem`, `ExternalContentModal`) indicate an ongoing process to improve how images are fetched, processed (using `IMGPROXY_PRESETS`), and displayed based on format, size, and context (e.g., `isBigRound`, `isKidsProfile`, `isPartner`). The `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` list is continuously refined.
*   **Conditional Rendering and Styling**: Extensive use of conditional rendering (e.g., `isLive(item)`, `shouldShowProgramTitle`, `isKidsProfile`, `isBigRound`) and dynamic class names (`className={...}`) is prevalent across JSX components and SCSS files.
*   **Debugging and Logging**: Presence of `console.log` and `ajsrConsole.log` statements, along with `InitDevConsole` and debug configuration components (`DebugConfigPane`, `DebugModalsLauncher`), suggests active debugging and a focus on providing development insights.
*   **Modal Management**: Handling of modals (ExitAppModal, ExternalContentModal, UserModal) is a recurring theme, with attention to their visibility, focus restoration, and specific actions (logout, exit app, open external content).
*   **Platform Specificity**: The code often includes checks for `window.AppGlobal.platform` (e.g., `webos`, `tizen`, `hbbtv`) to adapt behavior or styling to different Smart TV environments.
*   **React Hooks**: Heavy use of `useEffect`, `useState`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo` is evident, indicating a modern React functional component approach.

## 9:42:14
The code changes primarily occurred between February 2nd and February 5th, 2026, focusing on two main areas: Smart TV application logic (JavaScript/React) and styling (SCSS), with a minor update to a Tizen `config.xml` file.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\3cat_pro\gateway\js\app.js` (Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 14:16:27)**
    *   This file handles the initial application loading and connection management for WebOS.
    *   It determines the correct connection manager (`WEBOS_MANAGER` or `PALM_MANAGER`) and `REMOTE` URL based on the `sdkVersion` of the TV.
    *   It checks for internet connection availability. If available, it redirects to the `REMOTE` URL. If not, it displays an alert and sets up a subscription to monitor network status, redirecting once the connection is restored.
    *   It also includes a `keydown` handler for the `VK_BACK` key to trigger `webOS.platformBack()`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx` (Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 16:31:34)**
    *   This React component (`InfoGroup`) is responsible for displaying various media information (tags, title, description, duration, age rating, etc.).
    *   It imports several helper functions and components related to time formatting, image handling, and UI elements.
    *   **Significant logic changes:**
        *   `EpisodeCount` and `SeasonsCount` components are defined to display episode/season counts based on `episode_count` and `seasons_count`.
        *   A commented-out `Publication` component (`JIRA CCMA-2104`) indicates removed functionality for "A partir del" (available from) dates.
        *   `renderSeasonOrEpisodeCount` logic is updated to conditionally render `SeasonsCount` or `EpisodeCount`.
        *   `showExpiration` logic is introduced to display content expiration information if `unpublished_on` is present and within a 3-month window.
        *   Logic for determining `isLive` and `isUpcomingEvent` is added.
        *   The component handles dynamic title and description fetching from `item.default_episode`, `item.h2`, `item.presenter`, `item.description`, and `item.title` based on content type (live, audio, link, etc.).
        *   `shouldShowProgramTitle` and `shouldShowEpisodeTitle` memos control the visibility of titles based on `logoImage`, `is_episode`, `tag_format`, and `collection`.
        *   `rating_tags` are filtered to ensure they have valid labels.
        *   The `dotSeparatedItems` array (for displaying metadata) is updated to remove `showPublication` (related to CCMA-2104).
        *   It now supports rendering external content details, including a platform logo and `MediaTag` components for live or white tags based on `useExternalEmission`.
        *   Conditional rendering for `MediaTag` based on `item.tag_program`, `item.collection`, `item.start_date`, and `item.is_licensed` is present.
        *   Logo image sizing and filtering are adjusted based on `isLive` and `item.collection`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\mediaTitle\styles.scss` (Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 16:33:36)**
    *   Styling for `.mediaTitle` is defined, including color, font, size, line clamping, and text shadow.
    *   Specific styles are added for `.title_program`, `.live`, `.isLive_or_upcoming_event`, `.stream`, and `.menu_detail` (making it `font-weight: 700`). An `.external` class is also added with `font-size: 56px`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\portraitItem\styles.scss` (Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 16:39:57)**
    *   Styles for `.portraitItem`, including dimensions, margins, and `box-shadow` for focused states.
    *   `outline` property is explicitly set to `3px solid $base-color-3cat-red !important` for focused states.
    *   Styling for a `.tag` element is added, including `background-color`, `color`, `font-size`, `border-radius`, and `box-shadow`.
    *   `.future-date` and `.platform-logo` styles are introduced, the latter for displaying external platform logos.
    *   `&:hover` and `.V-SCROLLABLE:not(.fixed) &.focused` styles are added, which are identical to each other, applying a red box shadow and outline.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\keyboard\styles.scss` (Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 16:56:08 & 2/2/2026, 17:09:25)**
    *   Defines the layout and appearance of a virtual keyboard.
    *   Styles for `.keyboard`, `.keyboard-row`, and `.keyboard-key` are present, including `display: flex`, sizing, colors, `border-radius`, and `box-shadow` for focused states.
    *   Specific sizes (`SMALL`, `MEDIUM`, `LARGE`) and icons (`icon-BACKSPACE`, `icon-SPACE_BAR`, `icon-RETURN`) are defined for keyboard keys.
    *   The `focused` state involves a `box-shadow` with an inset effect and a red border.
    *   The second timestamp adds a `:hover` style for `.keyboard-key`, which mirrors the `focused` style (red box-shadow and border).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 17:08:44 & 5/2/2026, 13:32:40)**
    *   Initializes keyboard navigation for Smart TVs.
    *   `window.AppGlobal.KeyMemory` is used to store and check key combinations for specific actions (e.g., enabling/disabling ads with "123" or "321" sequences).
    *   `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartTV` function sets up global key listeners.
    *   It defines a `PLAYER_KEYS` set and logs ignored player keys if the player is not ready.
    *   A large `switch` statement handles common Smart TV key codes (`VK_UP`, `VK_DOWN`, `VK_LEFT`, `VK_RIGHT`, `VK_ENTER`, `VK_BACK`, `VK_ESCAPE`, `VK_BACK_SPACE`, and numeric keys).
    *   Platform-specific key handling is included for `webos` and `tizen` for media playback controls (Play, Pause, Stop, Rewind, Fast Forward).
    *   **Timestamp 5/2/2026, 13:32:40 change:** The `e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation();` lines at the beginning of `onKeyDownHandler` are commented out, and the `THROTTLE_MS` check is also commented out (`//if (now - lastTs < THROTTLE_MS) return;`). Additionally, `dispatchRewindEvent()` and `dispatchFastForwardEvent()` are commented out in the WebOS, Tizen, and "Other platforms" sections, suggesting a temporary disabling of throttling and specific player seek event dispatching.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\index.jsx` (Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 17:36:09 & 2/2/2026, 17:36:22)**
    *   This React component (`SideMenu`) manages the application's main navigation menu.
    *   It uses React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to manage menu state, data, and interactions.
    *   It handles the visibility and navigation between two menu levels (L1 and L2).
    *   `generateL1MenuData`, `generateL2MenuData_Explora`, `generateL2MenuData_User`, and `isOptionInMenu` functions are used to structure menu data based on `activeUser` type (kid or adult) and `settingsData`.
    *   A `refreshSelectedOption` function updates the menu's active state based on the current URL.
    *   The `attachSearchAtTheBeginning` function dynamically adds a 'Search' menu item to the beginning of the L1 menu.
    *   `manageFocused` handles focus management for menu navigation.
    *   `navigateTo` function handles routing within the application.
    *   Functions for opening/closing menu levels and handling user-related actions (`fnDoChangeUser`, `fnExitApp`) are defined.
    *   **Timestamp 2/2/2026, 17:36:22 change:** The line `window.__isEntry = isMenuVisible;` is added to the first `useEffect` hook, which implies setting a global flag `__isEntry` based on menu visibility.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\onboarding\usersScreen\index.jsx` (Timestamp: Multiple, between 2/2/2026, 17:45:11 and 2/2/2026, 18:14:59)**
    *   This React component (`UsersScreen`) allows users to select a profile (normal, kids, or add new).
    *   It manages local state for loading, users list, and uses `useAuthContext` for user authentication logic.
    *   `onSelectUser`, `onSelectKids`, and `onSelectAddUser` callbacks handle navigation and state updates based on user selection.
    *   It renders user bubbles and an "Add User" option (if `MAX_USERS_DISPLAYED` limit is not reached).
    *   An `isHbbtv` check conditionally renders a "Continua com a convidat" (Continue as guest) button.
    *   **Timestamp 2/2/2026, 17:45:11:** Initially, `window.__isEntry` is set from `location.state?.isEntry || false`. `onBackClick` for `PageHead` is conditional on `window.__isEntry`.
    *   **Timestamp 2/2/2026, 18:04:11:** `onBackClick` is always `window.AppGlobal.Actions.openExitAppModal`.
    *   **Timestamp 2/2/2026, 18:04:19:** The `useEffect` hook now explicitly calls `exitKidMode()` if `isLoading` is true.
    *   **Timestamp 2/2/2026, 18:05:33:** `window.__isEntry` is now explicitly set to `true`, overriding `location.state?.isEntry || false`.
    *   **Timestamp 2/2/2026, 18:06:13:** `location` import and `window.__isEntry` assignment from `location.state` are commented out, making `window.__isEntry` effectively undefined unless set elsewhere.
    *   **Timestamp 2/2/2026, 18:06:49:** The `location` import is uncommented, but `window.__isEntry = true;` remains.
    *   **Timestamp 2/2/2026, 18:09:47:** The explicit `window.__isEntry = true;` is removed, and it reverts to `location.state?.isEntry || false`.
    *   **Timestamp 2/2/2026, 18:10:38:** `window.__isEntry = true;` is re-added, but inside the `useEffect` hook that depends on `isLoading`.
    *   **Timestamp 2/2/2026, 18:14:59:** The `window.__isEntry` logic is removed from the `useEffect` and replaced with a new `useEffect` that sets `window.__foceEntry = true;` on mount and `false` on unmount. This suggests a change in how entry points are tracked.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\utils\goBackHistory.js` (Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 18:15:16)**
    *   The `goBackHistory` utility function now includes `window.__foceEntry` in its condition to determine if the `callBackFunc()` (likely `openExitAppModal`) should be executed instead of `window.history.go(-1)`. This change directly correlates with the `UsersScreen` update at `18:14:59`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (Timestamp: Multiple, between 2/2/2026, 18:50:50 and 2/2/2026, 19:14:36)**
    *   This is the main application component, handling routing, context providers, and global actions.
    *   It imports numerous components, contexts, and utilities.
    *   `InitDevConsole` function for a debug console is included.
    *   `BuildInfo` component displays various build and environment information based on `window.appConfig.test_app` flags.
    *   `AppInner` handles routing (`Routes` and `Route` components), including public and private routes.
    *   It initializes `window.AppGlobal.Actions.openExitAppModal` and `openCloseSessionModal`.
    *   `openExitAppModal` and `closeExitAppModal` functions manage the application exit modal state.
    *   `handleOk` handles actions for logout (navigating to `/welcomeScreen` or `/home` for HbbTV) or exit (dispatching `evChangeUser` or `evExitApplication`).
    *   **Timestamp 2/2/2026, 18:50:50, 18:50:56:** The `BrowserRouter` is updated with `future={{v7_startTransition: true, v7_relativeSplatPath: true}}`.
    *   **Timestamp 2/2/2026, 18:51:35:** `window.isUserModalVisible = true; nav.storedFocus = nav.getCurrentId(); setExitModal(ModalTypes.EXIT);` are commented out within `openExitAppModal`.
    *   **Timestamp 2/2/2026, 18:52:39:** `window.AppMenu.manageFocused?.();` is added within `openExitAppModal` before the commented-out lines.
    *   **Timestamp 2/2/2026, 18:54:07:** The previously commented-out lines in `openExitAppModal` (`window.isUserModalVisible = true; nav.storedFocus = nav.getCurrentId(); setExitModal(ModalTypes.EXIT);`) are uncommented, while `window.AppMenu.manageFocused?.();` remains. This restores the full functionality of opening the exit modal.
    *   **Timestamp 2/2/2026, 19:14:36:** `window.AppMenu.manageFocused?.();` is removed from `openExitAppModal`, returning it to the state of `18:50:50`.

    *   This XML configuration file for Tizen applications defines application metadata, privileges, and settings.
    *   **Timestamp 3/2/2026, 13:24:24:** Initial version shown.
    *   **Timestamp 5/2/2026, 10:47:12 change:** The `id` attribute of the `<widget>` element is changed from `http://tizen.tv3.ccma.cat.qa` to `http://tizen.qa.ccma.cat`. Similarly, the `id` attribute of the `<tizen:application>` element is changed from `PzkKxRdFT6.TV3.qa` to `PzkKxRdFT6qa.TV3`. These changes indicate a rebranding or namespace update for the Tizen application.
    *   **Timestamp 5/2/2026, 11:41:17:** No visible code changes compared to the previous entry, suggesting a re-save or minor, unlogged modification.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx` (Timestamp: Multiple, between 4/2/2026, 11:36:24 and 4/2/2026, 14:01:29)**
    *   This React component (`RoundItem`) displays a circular item, often for categories or user profiles.
    *   It uses `registerFocusAction` and `unregisterFocusAction` for managing focus.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 11:36:24:** Initial version. The `image` and `type` are determined based on `item.images` (looking for 'round' or 'logo' formats). The `isKidsProfile` prop is commented out in the `useMemo` hook, effectively always using the non-kid logic.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 11:41:47:** The `isKidsProfile` logic within the `useMemo` hook is uncommented. If `isKidsProfile` is true, it specifically looks for `image_format === 'round'` and sets `type: 'kids-round'`.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 12:08:06:** For `isKidsProfile`, the `image_format` sought changes from `'round'` to `'big-round'`.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 12:21:39:** The `isKidsProfile` check in `useMemo` is completely removed, simplifying the image selection back to always looking for `round` then `logo` format images. The `className` for `roundElement` also simplifies, removing `|| type === 'kids-round'`.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 12:56:53:** The `isKidsProfile` prop is removed from the component's destructuring, reflecting the removal of related logic.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 13:44:19:** `isKidsProfile` prop is reintroduced. The image selection logic for `isKidsProfile` is added back, specifically looking for `image_format === 'round'` and setting `type: 'kids-round'`.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 13:44:59:** `isKidsProfile` is renamed to `isBigRound` in the prop destructuring and the `useMemo` logic. If `isBigRound` is true, it looks for `image_format === 'round'` and sets `type: 'big-round'`.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 13:45:13 & 4/2/2026, 13:45:24:** Minor consistency fix in `className` within `roundElement` and `className` within `img` element to correctly apply `round-image` and `round-img` classes based on `type`.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 13:48:20:** If `isBigRound` is true, the `image_format` sought is now `big-round`, and the `type` is set to `big-round`. This is a crucial change for differentiating between standard round and "big round" items.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 14:01:29:** The `data-nav-fixed-focus-shape` attribute is dynamically set to `isBigRound ? 'bigRound' : 'round'`, enabling distinct focus styling for different round item sizes.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.scss` (Timestamp: 4/2/2026, 13:53:09)**
    *   Introduces styles for `.roundElement`, defining its default size, shape, borders, and text properties.
    *   Includes a `.round-image` class to adjust `width` and `height` when an image is present.
    *   Adds a new `.biground_row` class with specific overrides for `.roundElement` within it, increasing its `width` and `height`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.kids.scss` (Timestamp: Multiple, between 4/2/2026, 12:22:36 and 4/2/2026, 14:12:14)**
    *   This SCSS file provides kid-mode specific styling for `RoundItem` components.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 12:22:36:** The `background-color` for `.roundElement` in kid mode is commented out.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 12:22:48:** The `background-color` is uncommented and set to `$base-color-3cat-kid-bright-purple;`.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 12:23:43:** A `border` is added to `.roundElement` in kid mode, matching the background color.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 12:25:30:** The `border` property is removed.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 13:54:47:** The `border` property is re-added, matching the background color.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 14:12:14:** The `border` property is removed again.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.kids.scss` (Timestamp: Multiple, between 4/2/2026, 12:26:49 and 4/2/2026, 14:14:40)**
    *   This SCSS file styles the fixed focus indicator specifically for kid mode.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 12:26:49:** Sets `box-shadow` and `border-color` for `.inner` elements in kid mode to `$base-color-3cat-kid-light-purple`. Also has commented-out styles for `.round` focus.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 12:33:20:** Removes `_outline` and `border: 0px; outline: 0px;` properties from `.inner`.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 12:35:24:** Reintroduces `_outline`, `border: 0px; outline: 0px;`.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 12:35:49:** Removes `_outline`, `border: 0px; outline: 0px;`.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 12:37:39:** Adds an explicit `outline: 3px solid #be2649;` to `.inner` and defines styles for `&.round .inner` with a larger `width`, `height`, `box-shadow`, and `border`.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 12:37:59:** Updates `outline` for `.inner` to `$base-color-3cat-kid-light-purple` and removes specific styles from `&.round .inner`, setting `outline: 0px;`.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 12:42:40:** Reintroduces `width`, `height`, `box-shadow`, and `border` for `&.round .inner`.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 12:43:30:** Reverts to the styles of `12:26:49` with `_outline`, `border: 0px; outline: 0px;`.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 12:44:18:** Removes `_outline`, `border: 0px; outline: 0px;` again, and sets `outline: 0px;` for `&.round .inner`.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 14:02:51:** Reverts `.inner` to a simpler style with `box-shadow`, `border-color`, and `outline` all using `$base-color-3cat-kid-light-purple`. The `&.round` block is removed.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 14:06:31:** No visible changes, likely a re-save.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 14:14:22:** Adds `&.round, &.big-round` to specifically target round and big-round focus outlines, setting their `outline: 0px;`.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 14:14:40:** `&.big-round` is corrected to `&.bigRound`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\rowUtils.js` (Timestamp: 4/2/2026, 12:01:27 & 4/2/2026, 12:01:36)**
    *   `getRowkind` function determines the type of row based on `rowData` properties.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 12:01:36 change:** The `rowData.format` check for `ROUND` is updated from `square-mini` to `square_mini`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (Timestamp: Multiple, between 4/2/2026, 12:02:26 and 4/2/2026, 12:54:35)**
    *   This React component (`GenericRow`) renders various types of content rows.
    *   `getRowElement` maps `rowType` to specific item components (e.g., `LandscapeItem`, `PortraitItem`).
    *   `getShowAllElementsFocusShape` determines the focus shape for "Show All" elements.
    *   `generateShowAllElements` creates a "Show All" button.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 12:02:26:** Initial version.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 12:49:54:** The `getRowElement` and `getShowAllElementsFocusShape` functions are updated to include a `SQUARE_MINI` case, which now maps to `SquareItem` and `square` focus shape respectively.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 12:54:35:** A conditional rendering `isKidsProfile && <div className="roundItemTitle">{item.title}</div>` is added at the end of the component's `return` statement, attempting to display an item title in kid mode for round items (though `item` is not directly accessible at that scope for `GenericRow`). This seems like a misplaced or incomplete change as `item` is not defined at this level.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\styles.scss` (Timestamp: 4/2/2026, 12:48:42)**
    *   Styling for `.generic_row` and its different types (`rowType_HERO`, `rowType_LANDSCAPE`, etc.).
    *   Introduces specific `height` adjustments for `.rowType_LANDSCAPE` and `.rowType_LIVE_TV` when they are `.externalRow`.
    *   Adds styles for `.rowType_SQUARE_MINI`, including a `.roundItemTitle` for it.
    *   Defines styles for the `.item-show-all` button, including `background-color`, `width`, `height`, and `hover` effects.
    *   Provides type-specific overrides for `.item-show-all` (e.g., `.LANDSCAPE`, `.PORTRAIT`, `.SQUARE`, `.SQUARE_MINI`).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\index.jsx` (Timestamp: Multiple, between 4/2/2026, 12:27:53 and 4/2/2026, 13:42:39)**
    *   This React component (`RoundRow`) specifically renders rows of `RoundItem` components.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 12:27:53:** Includes an `isKidsProfile` prop, which affects the `textAlign` of `roundItemWrapper`.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 12:30:58:** Removes the import for `styles.kids.scss` and the `isKidsProfile` prop. The `textAlign` of `roundItemWrapper` is hardcoded to `'left'`.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 13:35:58:** Reintroduces `styles.kids.scss` and replaces `isKidsProfile` with `isBigRound` prop. `textAlign` is now conditional on `isBigRound`. A `roundItemTitle` is conditionally rendered if `isBigRound` is true.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 13:38:35:** The main `div` for the row is changed to use a dynamic class name `isBigRound ? 'biground_row' : 'round_row'` based on the `isBigRound` prop.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 13:42:39:** The import for `styles.kids.scss` is removed again, but the `isBigRound` logic remains in the component itself.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\styles.scss` (Timestamp: 4/2/2026, 12:28:04 & 4/2/2026, 13:40:37)**
    *   Styling for `.round_row` components.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 12:28:04:** Initial styling for `.round_row`.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 13:40:37:** Introduces a new `.biground_row` class and refactors common styles for both `.round_row` and `.biground_row`. It defines distinct `height` for each. Also, adds styling for `.roundItemTitle`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\styles.kids.scss` (Timestamp: 4/2/2026, 12:30:18)**
    *   Kid-mode specific styles for `round_row`. Initially, a commented-out height adjustment for `round_row`.

    *   This React component (`Page`) is responsible for rendering content pages, including rows of media, and managing live content refreshing.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 13:25:55 & 4/2/2026, 13:26:44:** Updates to filter `data.children` based on `isLiveSupportedRef` (to remove live content if not supported) and `isShakaPlayerSupportedRef` (to remove 'CANALS TEMÀTICS' if not supported). It also filters out external content for HbbTV platform and 'user_row' for Kid users.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 13:34:44:** No visible code changes, likely a re-save or minor, unlogged modification.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.scss` (Timestamp: Multiple, between 4/2/2026, 14:02:04 and 4/2/2026, 14:26:32)**
    *   Styling for the `fixed-focus` element.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 14:02:04:** Initial definition of focus styles for different shapes (`keyframe`, `round`, `poster`, `square`, `landscape-mini`).
    *   Introduces a `.bigRound` class for focus, but initially mirrors `.round` in dimensions.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 14:02:35:** Updates `.bigRound` to have `width: 275px; height: 275px;` and uses kid-mode specific colors (`$base-color-3cat-kid-light-purple`) for its `box-shadow` and `border`.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 14:03:39:** No visible changes, likely a re-save.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 14:09:26:** The `.page` block now includes `&.round, &.bigRound` for its `top` and `left` positioning.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 14:26:06:** The colors for `box-shadow` and `border` within `&.bigRound .inner` are updated to `$base-color-3cat-kid-white`.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 14:26:27 & 4/2/2026, 14:26:32:** Adds `!important` to the `box-shadow` and `border` properties within `&.bigRound .inner`, ensuring these styles take precedence.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.kids.scss` (Timestamp: 4/2/2026, 14:18:09)**
    *   Introduces kid-mode specific styling for focused elements within scrollable containers.
    *   Sets `box-shadow`, `border-color`, and `outline` to `$base-color-3cat-kid-light-purple !important` for `.V-SCROLLABLE:not(.fixed) .focused`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\index.jsx` (Timestamp: Multiple, between 4/2/2026, 15:12:08 and 4/2/2026, 15:17:01)**
    *   This React component (`ExternalContentModal`) displays a modal for external content.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 15:12:08:** Initial implementation. It displays `PopupInfoGroup`, `GenericButton`s, and handles `promoText`, `platformText`, and images.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 15:15:17:** The `popupLeft` div now dynamically receives a `partner` class if `isPartner` is true. The image logic is updated to skip rendering the `platformLogoContainer` if `isPartner`.
    *   **Timestamp 4/2/2026, 15:17:01:** The `generateImageData` call now conditionally passes `428` or `544` for the `height` (`h`) parameter based on `isPartner`. The dependency array for `useMemo` is also updated to include `isPartner`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss` (Timestamp: 4/2/2026, 15:15:02)**
    *   Styling for the `externalModalOverlay` and `externalPopup`.
    *   Includes styles for `popupLeft` and `popupRight` sections of the modal.
    *   Adds a `.partner` class for `popupLeft` to adjust its `height` to `428px`.
    *   Defines styles for `platformLogoContainer`, `promoTextRow`, `platformTextRow`, and `popupButtons`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\libs\img.js` (Timestamp: Multiple, between 5/2/2026, 9:38:25 and 5/2/2026, 9:46:57)**
    *   This utility file provides functions for image handling, including `getImgProxyUrl`, `removeItemsFromArray`, `getBestImage`, `getBestImageV2`, `getLogoImage`, `getImageByFormat`, and `generateImageData`.
    *   **Timestamp 5/2/2026, 9:38:25:** `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` array is defined and includes `round` twice. `getBestImage` and `getBestImageV2` use this array.
    *   **Timestamp 5/2/2026, 9:38:51:** `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` in `getBestImageV2` is specifically cloned using `[...NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS]`. A new image format `square-round` is added to `notAllowedFomats` within `getBestImageV2` if `desiredAspect` is `LANDSCAPE`.
    *   **Timestamp 5/2/2026, 9:40:12:** No visible changes, likely a re-save.
    *   **Timestamp 5/2/2026, 9:40:33:** The `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` array itself is updated to remove one duplicate `round` and add `square-round`.
    *   **Timestamp 5/2/2026, 9:44:04:** The `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` array is simplified further, removing `square-round` from the global list. However, within `getBestImageV2`, `big-round` is added to the `notAllowedFomats` array when `desiredAspect` is `LANDSCAPE`.
    *   **Timestamp 5/2/2026, 9:46:50 & 5/2/2026, 9:46:57:** The `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` array is reverted to include `square-round` and the `notAllowedFomats` array in `getBestImageV2` continues to include `big-round` when `desiredAspect` is `LANDSCAPE`. The primary change involves adding a fallback to `item.channel.images` in `generateImageDataFromLiveChannelInHome_v2` if other image sources are empty.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Date Formatting and Timestamps:** All timestamps are consistently from February 2nd to February 5th, 2026. Many internal date/time utility functions (`formatDateToCatalan`, `formatFullDateWithLabelUTC`, `formatCatalanDayMonthWithLabelUTC`) are imported and used in `infoGroup\index.jsx`.
*   **React Component Development:** A significant portion of the changes involves React components (`infoGroup\index.jsx`, `sideMenu\index.jsx`, `usersScreen\index.jsx`, `genericRow\index.jsx`, `roundItem\index.jsx`, `roundRow\index.jsx`, `page\index.jsx`, `externalContentModal\index.jsx`, `App.jsx`).
    *   **Hooks Usage:** Consistent use of `useEffect`, `useState`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, and `useRef` for managing component state, lifecycle, and performance.
    *   **Context API:** Heavy reliance on React Contexts (`AuthContext`, `SettingsContext`, `CapabilitiesContext`, `VirtualizationContext`, `HighlightContext`, `SitecatalystContext`, `BroadcastContext`, `DidomiProvider`, `ParentalControlProvider`, `HistoryProvider`, `OptionsProvider`, `TextsContextProvider`) for global state management and data sharing.
*   **Styling with SCSS:** Extensive use of SCSS for component styling, including nested rules, imports (`../../colors.scss`), and specific class-based targeting (e.g., `.kid-mode`, `.focused`, `&.round`).
    *   **Focus Management:** A strong pattern of applying focus styles (`box-shadow`, `border`, `outline`) for interactive elements, often using a global `nav` object and `focusActionRegistry`. There are also specific "kid-mode" focus styles using different color palettes.
    *   **Theming/Kid Mode:** A recurring theme is the implementation and adjustment of "kid-mode" specific logic and styling (`.kids.scss` files, `isKidsProfile` prop, color variables like `$base-color-3cat-kid-bright-purple`, `$base-color-3cat-kid-light-purple`, `$base-color-3cat-kid-white`). This includes visual changes (background color, focus outline colors) and functional changes (menu structure, row filtering).
*   **Platform Specificity:** The application often adapts its behavior based on the detected platform (`window.AppGlobal.platform === 'webos'`, `window.AppGlobal.platform === 'tizen'`, `window.AppGlobal.platform === 'hbbtv'`). This is seen in keyboard navigation, image filtering, and routing.
*   **Image Handling:** Several updates relate to how images are selected, processed, and displayed, particularly with different `image_format` types (`round`, `big-round`, `logo`, `portrait`, `landscape`, `square-round`, etc.) and the use of an image proxy (`IMGPROXY_PRESETS`, `getImgProxyUrl`).
*   **Error Handling and Authentication:** The `Page` component includes robust error handling for API calls, redirecting to authentication screens (`/qrAuthScreen`) on "Unauthorized" or "Token expired" errors, and logging out users.
*   **Global `window.AppGlobal` Object:** Many components interact with a global `window.AppGlobal` object to access shared utilities, actions, player controls, and debug information. This suggests a legacy or cross-component communication pattern.
*   **Redundant Code/Refactoring:** There are instances of lines being commented out, re-added, or slightly modified (e.g., in `platform\generic.js` and `usersScreen\index.jsx`), which could indicate active development, debugging, or iterative refactoring. The duplicate `round` in `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` in `img.js` also suggests some uncleaned code.
