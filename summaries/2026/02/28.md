# Activity Summary for 28/2/2026

## 4:17:49
The provided log details changes across several files, primarily focusing on updates to the `src\views\page\index.jsx` component, `src\platform\generic.js` for keyboard navigation, and `src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx` for UI virtualization, with minor adjustments in `index.html`, `src\App.jsx`, `src\platform\tizen\tizen.js`, `src\player\playerLoader.jsx`, `src\fonts.scss`, `src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx`, and `src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx`.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (Frequent Changes: 20/2/2026 12:11:57 - 24/2/2026 14:44:26, 25/2/2026 11:20:38 - 25/2/2026 11:23:07)**
    *   **Initial Changes (20/2/2026 12:11:57 - 12:12:08):** A minor change in the `live_refresh_interval` from `3000` to `10000` was made, and then reverted to `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`. This indicates testing or adjustments to the live data refresh rate.
    *   **Refactoring `checkTimeFrame` and `setPageData` (23/2/2026 19:09:03):** The `checkTimeFrame` function was significantly refactored. It now uses a `Set` to track `livePositionsToUpdate`, and the `setPageData` logic was updated to differentiate between initial page load (`!hasRefreshed.current`) and subsequent live row updates, aiming for more efficient re-renders by only updating changed rows on subsequent refreshes. This change was then reverted and re-implemented in different ways.
    *   **Debugging `checkTimeFrame` (23/2/2026 23:31:18):** A `console.log(homeDataRef.current)` was added inside `checkTimeFrame`, suggesting debugging efforts.
    *   **Interval for `setPageData` (23/2/2026 23:33:59):** An `setInterval` was briefly introduced in `checkTimeFrame` to update `pageData` every 2 seconds, which was later removed. This likely points to attempts to control the rendering frequency for live data.
    *   **`live_refresh_interval` Adjustments (23/2/2026 23:39:38, 23/2/2026 23:58:29, 24/2/2026 0:00:35, 24/2/2026 0:00:58, 24/2/2026 0:01:26):** The `live_refresh_interval` was repeatedly toggled between a hardcoded `1000` or `2000` and the `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000` value, indicating experimentation with live refresh rates.
    *   **`setPageData` and `filterChildren` Logic Modifications (24/2/2026 0:04:01, 24/2/2026 0:06:46, 24/2/2026 0:08:59, 24/2/2026 12:55:28, 24/2/2026 12:56:38, 24/2/2026 12:57:22, 24/2/2026 13:00:39, 24/2/2026 13:03:18):** There were several iterations of logic within `checkTimeFrame` related to how `setPageData` is called and how `newChildren` (derived from `filterChildren`) is compared to `prev.children` to prevent unnecessary re-renders. A specific line `c = c.filter((_, index) => index !== 3);` was added and removed multiple times within `checkTimeFrame`, suggesting dynamic removal of a specific row (index 3), likely for testing purposes.
    *   **`live_refresh_interval` Increased and Interval for Row Removal (24/2/2026 13:10:49, 24/2/2026 13:10:59):** The `live_refresh_interval` was significantly increased to `6000000` (likely disabling the interval for debugging) while a `setTimeout` was introduced to dynamically remove a row (index 3) after 20 seconds. This indicates testing of dynamic row removal. This `setTimeout` was then removed.
    *   **Re-introduction of Row Removal Logic within `checkTimeFrame` (24/2/2026 13:43:58, 24/2/2026 13:45:08):** The `newChildren.splice(3, 1)` logic was re-added within `checkTimeFrame` conditional on `hasRefreshed.current`, implying a mechanism to remove a specific row after the initial load.
    *   **Virtualization Reset on Row Count Change (24/2/2026 13:46:15, 24/2/2026 14:17:47):** Logic was added to `setPageData` in `checkTimeFrame` to call `resetVirtualization()` and `removeVirtualizationState(location.pathname)` if `rowsChanged` is true, followed by navigating back to the current path. This ensures the virtualization state is correctly reset when the number of rows changes.
    *   **Reverted interval in `useEffect` (24/2/2026 13:40:08):** A `useEffect` block containing a `setInterval` that simulated changes and removed a row was added, then later removed. This was another attempt to test dynamic content changes and virtualization.
    *   **Final `setPageData` Update Logic (24/2/2026 14:39:42 - 24/2/2026 14:44:26, 25/2/2026 11:20:38 - 25/2/2026 11:23:07):** The conditional check for `prev && prev.children.length != newChildren.length` was consistently applied to trigger a full reset of virtualization and navigation when the number of rows changes, which is a key pattern for handling dynamic content in a virtualized list.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html` (20/2/2026 12:16:22)**
    *   Updated the Shaka Player version from `shaka-4-7-1.js` to `shaka.4.13.8.js`, indicating a player dependency upgrade.
    *   Cleaned up commented-out script tags for Shaka Player and vtt.js.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (20/2/2026 12:16:57)**
    *   Added `VideoSpinner` component import and usage, suggesting the addition of a loading indicator for video playback.
    *   Included a `BroadcastProvider` for HbbTV platforms, indicating platform-specific context management.
    *   Updated `BrowserRouter` with `future={{v7_startTransition: true, v7_relativeSplatPath: true}}`, preparing for future React Router v7 features.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (20/2/2026 13:13:26)**
    *   Added console logging for Tizen device information and visibility change events.
    *   Implemented `evExitApplication` event listener to gracefully exit the Tizen application.
    *   Introduced `initNetworkStateListener` to dispatch `evNetworkDisconnected` and `evNetworkConnected` events, improving network state handling.
    *   Enhanced `initExtraSamsungKeys` to register a wider range of Samsung TV remote keys, including numeric, media control, and color buttons.
    *   Added `launchAppTizen` and `openSamsungStore` functions, allowing the application to launch other Tizen apps or open the Samsung app store.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerLoader.jsx` (20/2/2026 18:52:39)**
    *   Improved ad URL handling by replacing a simple query strip with a `build3catVmapUrl` function for more robust macro replacement in VMAP URLs.
    *   Added `window.BufferingIndicator.show()` and `hide()` calls to manage a global buffering indicator.
    *   Implemented `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.disable()` and `enable()` for controlling screen saver behavior during playback.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (Frequent Changes: 20/2/2026 18:58:23 - 20/2/2026 19:25:16)**
    *   Modified keyboard event handling. Specifically, `e.preventDefault()` was commented out and then re-enabled, and `e.stopPropagation()` was commented out, re-enabled, and then moved to the end of the `onKeyDownHandler` function, indicating fine-tuning of event propagation control for keyboard inputs across different Smart TV platforms.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss` (23/2/2026 12:40:42)**
    *   Added new `@font-face` definitions for "Bw 3Cat" and "Roboto" fonts, including different weights and styles, and specified both TTF and WOFF formats for "Bw 3Cat." The `body` element was updated to use "Bw 3Cat" as the primary font.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx` (23/2/2026 17:26:19 - 23/2/2026 17:27:28)**
    *   Removed a `setInterval` that was refreshing local favorites every 3 seconds from the `useEffect` hook, streamlining the favorite status update mechanism to rely solely on `isFavorite` state changes or `item` prop changes.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx` (23/2/2026 19:07:16)**
    *   Updated the `useMemo` for `imgData` to use `generateImageDataFromLiveChannelInHome_v2`.
    *   Improved the `channelLogo` logic to fall back to `item.stream` if `item.channel` is not available.
    *   Modified the `title` rendering to concatenate `item.h1` and `item.presenter` for audio type items.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx` (Frequent Changes: 24/2/2026 10:52:48 - 24/2/2026 14:18:59)**
    *   **Navigation Logic Refinements (24/2/2026 10:52:48, 24/2/2026 10:56:20):** Improved the `handleRowNavigation` logic, especially for wrapping around rows (going down from the last row jumps to the first, and vice-versa) and adjusting the `accumulatedTop` based on whether the visible window moves up or down. This aims to maintain smooth scrolling and focus within the virtualized list.
    *   **Reverted `syncVirtualizationWithData` (24/2/2026 14:18:41, 24/2/2026 14:18:59):** The `syncVirtualizationWithData` function was temporarily introduced and then removed from the return of the hook, suggesting an attempt to centralize virtualization state synchronization that was later discarded or integrated differently.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (24/2/2026 20:47:55)**
    *   Minor refactoring in `generateShowAllElements` with `useEffect` for focus actions.
    *   Updated `onFocusAction` logic for `LandscapeItem` to pass `null` for `teasers` and `dismissFadeIn: true`.
    *   Changed the default `live_refresh_interval` from `3000` to `1000`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

1.  **Live Data Refresh Logic:** The `Page` component (`index.jsx`) frequently deals with fetching and refreshing "Now Playing" live data. There's a recurring pattern of setting up an `setInterval` for `refreshLives` and using `hasRefreshed` ref to manage initial loads versus subsequent refreshes. The `live_refresh_interval` itself is a point of frequent modification, suggesting ongoing tuning of how often live data is updated.
2.  **Virtualization Management:** The `useVirtualizedRows` hook and its integration into `Page` show a strong focus on optimizing performance for lists of rows. Repeated changes to `setVisibleRows`, `setAccumulatedTranslate`, `setAccumulatedTop`, and `setCurrentRow`, along with `resetVirtualization` and `removeVirtualizationState`, indicate continuous work on ensuring smooth scrolling and efficient rendering for dynamic lists, especially when the underlying data (`pageData.children`) changes. The `checkTimeFrame` function in `Page` also frequently interacts with how `setPageData` is called to manage these virtualized rows.
3.  **Platform-Specific Adaptations:** Files like `index.html`, `src\App.jsx`, `src\platform\tizen\tizen.js`, and `src\platform\generic.js` show an explicit concern for platform compatibility (HbbTV, Tizen, WebOS, generic Smart TV). This includes:
    *   Specific Shaka Player versions.
    *   Conditional rendering or logic based on `window.AppGlobal.platform`.
    *   Extensive keyboard event handling (`onKeyDownHandler`) with distinct keycode mappings for WebOS and Tizen.
    *   Tizen-specific API calls for device info, network state, app launching, and screensaver control.
4.  **Debugging and Testing:** Numerous `console.log` statements (e.g., in `tizen.js`, `playerLoader.jsx`, `generic.js`, `btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx`) and temporary code blocks (like the `setInterval` in `Page` to remove items dynamically) suggest active debugging and testing during development. The frequent changes and reverts in `Page`'s `checkTimeFrame` function demonstrate iterative testing of rendering and data update strategies.
5.  **Focus Management:** The use of `useFixedFocus` and custom events like `customNavigation`, along with `registerFocusAction` and `unregisterFocusAction` in components like `LiveItemHome` and `GenericRow`, highlight a robust focus management system tailored for Smart TV navigation. The `nav.fixedFocus.isNavigating` flag is consistently used to control navigation behavior during fixed focus.
6.  **Dependency Updates:** The update of Shaka Player in `index.html` and the use of React Router v7 future flags in `App.jsx` indicate that the project is keeping its dependencies relatively up-to-date or preparing for future upgrades.

## 9:19:38
The provided log details significant development activity within the `3cat_smarttv` project, primarily focusing on the `src\views\page\index.jsx` file, which appears to be a core component for displaying page content, likely a home or category page. There are also updates to `index.html`, `src\App.jsx`, `src\platform\tizen\tizen.js`, `src\player\playerLoader.jsx`, `src\platform\generic.js`, `src\fonts.scss`, `src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx`, `src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx`, `src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx`, and `src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx`.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (20/2/2026 12:11:57 - 24/2/2026 20:50:12)**:
    *   This file underwent numerous changes across multiple timestamps, indicating active development on the main page component.
    *   **Initial Change (20/2/2026, 12:11:57):** The `live_refresh_interval` variable was hardcoded to `3000` (commented out `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`).
    *   **Subsequent Change (20/2/2026, 12:12:08):** The `live_refresh_interval` was changed back to `10000` (commented out `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`), effectively restoring the default/fallback value.
    *   **Later changes (starting 23/2/2026):**
        *   The `live_refresh_interval` was reverted to dynamically use `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`.
        *   Extensive modifications were made within the `checkTimeFrame` helper function and the `setPageData` calls.
        *   There was a period (23/2/2026 17:31:09 to 23/2/2026 23:31:18) where `setPageData` was commented out and `homeDataRef.current` was directly mutated before `setPageData` was uncommented and then briefly wrapped in a `setInterval` with a 2-second delay (23/2/2026 23:33:59). This suggests attempts to optimize or control rendering updates for live data.
        *   The `live_refresh_interval` was again briefly hardcoded to `2000` (23/2/2026 23:39:38).
        *   A more complex logic was introduced in `checkTimeFrame` (23/2/2026 19:09:03) to handle full re-renders only on the first load (`!hasRefreshed.current`) and then selectively update only "live rows" in subsequent refreshes using `setPageData(prev => ...)` to avoid unnecessary re-renders. This logic was then largely reverted or simplified in later changes, suggesting challenges with this optimization.
        *   A `setTimeout` was introduced (24/2/2026 13:07:23 onwards) in `checkTimeFrame` to filter out an item at index 3 from `pageData.children` after a delay (initially 10 seconds, then 20 seconds, then 1ms, then removed). This likely indicates debugging or testing a dynamic removal of content.
        *   A new `useEffect` hook was added (24/2/2026 13:40:08) to simulate live data updates and an item removal (specifically `splice(3, 1)` to remove the 4th item) every 10 seconds, using `fakeEntries`. This was probably a temporary testing mechanism.
        *   Changes related to `resetVirtualization()` and `removeVirtualizationState()` were introduced within `setPageData`'s update logic when `rowsChanged` (24/2/2026 14:15:20 to 14:39:42), indicating an attempt to re-initialize virtualization state upon significant data structure changes.
        *   The `live_refresh_interval` was temporarily set to `6000000` (very long) in some commits (e.g., 24/2/2026 13:07:41), likely to pause or control live refresh during debugging.
        *   The debugging `useEffect` simulating removal was commented out (24/2/2026 14:41:54).
        *   The logic for re-initializing virtualization state on `rowsChanged` within `setPageData` was frequently added and removed or modified, suggesting issues with its implementation or desired behavior. By 24/2/2026 20:50:12, it looks like this explicit `resetVirtualization` and `navigate` logic was removed from `checkTimeFrame`.

2.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html` (20/2/2026 12:16:22)**:
    *   Updated the `shaka.js` player library from `shaka-4-7-1.js` to `shaka.4.13.8.js`.
    *   Added `ima3.js` for Google IMA SDK.
    *   The `title` meta tag was changed from "3Cat" to "3Cat, la plataforma digital de continguts en català i de qualitat".

3.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (20/2/2026 12:16:57)**:
    *   Added a new context provider `ParentalControlProvider` and wrapped `VirtualizationProvider` within it.
    *   Updated `BrowserRouter` with new `future` props (`v7_startTransition: true, v7_relativeSplatPath: true`).
    *   Introduced `VideoSpinner` component.

4.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (20/2/2026 13:13:26)**:
    *   Improved logging for Tizen device information and added debug calls (`debugTizenAppCommon`).
    *   Enhanced `visibilitychange` event handling to pause/stop `webapis.avplay` when hidden and play when resumed.
    *   Added `webapis.avplay.stop()` to the `visibilitychange` handler's hidden branch.
    *   Updated the `openSamsungStore` function to include `caller_id` in `ApplicationControlData`.

5.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerLoader.jsx` (20/2/2026 18:52:39)**:
    *   Modified the handling of `vmapUrl` for advertisements, moving from stripping query parameters to using a new `build3catVmapUrl` function for macro replacement with real values. This indicates a more sophisticated ad integration.
    *   Added `window.BufferingIndicator.show()` and `hide()` calls within `useEffect` for better buffering indication.
    *   Added screen saver disable/enable calls around player lifecycle.
    *   Added calls to `removeSubtitlesStyles()` on component cleanup.

6.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (20/2/2026 18:58:23 - 20/2/2026 19:25:16)**:
    *   The `onKeyDownHandler` function saw repeated changes regarding `e.stopPropagation()`:
        *   Initially commented out (18:58:23).
        *   Then uncommented (`e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation();`) (19:05:58).
        *   `e.stopPropagation()` was commented out again, leaving only `e.preventDefault();` (19:15:17).
        *   `e.stopPropagation()` was moved to the end of the `onKeyDownHandler` function (19:21:43).
        *   Finally, `e.stopPropagation()` was removed completely from the end of the `onKeyDownHandler` (19:25:16). This suggests careful fine-tuning of event propagation behavior.

7.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss` (23/2/2026 12:40:42)**:
    *   Added several `@font-face` rules for "Roboto" font with various weights (Black, Bold, Light, Medium, Regular, Thin), indicating an expansion of font usage in the application.

8.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx` (23/2/2026 17:26:19 - 23/2/2026 17:27:28)**:
    *   An `setInterval` to refresh local favorites every 3 seconds was removed (23/2/2026 17:27:28). The `refresh_LOCAL_FavoritesList` is now called only on initial component mount and when `item` changes.

9.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx` (23/2/2026 19:07:16)**:
    *   Improved image data generation (`generateImageDataFromLiveChannelInHome_v2`).
    *   Updated `channelLogo` logic to also check `item.stream` for images.
    *   Enhanced `onFocusAction` callback in `useEffect` to trigger only if `origin !== 'mouse'`.
    *   Added `data-group-restore-last-focused='true'` attribute.
    *   Introduced `platform-footer` for external content with platform logo and an external link icon.
    *   Added logic to display "LIVE" or "UPCOMING" tags for external content.
    *   Modified the display of `item.h1` and `item.h2` for audio content to include presenter information.

10. **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx` (24/2/2026 10:52:48 - 24/2/2026 14:18:59)**:
    *   Significant refactoring of the row virtualization logic.
    *   **10:52:48:** Simplified `handleRowNavigation` logic for `newVisibleRows` calculation and moved `setCurrentRow` and `setVisibleRows` updates to the end of the function.
    *   **10:56:20:** Introduced a wrap-around behavior for "down" navigation (if at last row, jump to first). Added logic to adjust `accumulatedTop` only if the visible window `start` changes.
    *   **14:14:06 - 14:18:59:** The `syncVirtualizationWithData` function was temporarily imported and then removed, suggesting an attempt to handle virtualization state more intelligently when the underlying data changes, which was then reverted or absorbed into `resetVirtualization`.

11. **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (24/2/2026 20:47:55)**:
    *   Updated the `onFocusAction` logic for `LandscapeProgressBarItem` and `Inline` (PrescriptorItem) row types, conditionally setting `item.teasers` to `null` and `dismissFadeIn` to `true`. This suggests fine-tuning of focus behavior for these specific row types.
    *   Minor adjustments to props passed to `RowElement`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Focus Management and Navigation:** Numerous changes across `index.jsx` (page view), `generic.js` (platform keyboard handling), and `useVirtualizedRows.jsx` (custom hook) indicate a strong focus on refining the navigation and focus behavior, especially in a Smart TV context. This includes handling fixed focus, virtualized rows, and custom navigation events (`customNavigation`).
*   **Live Content Handling:** The `checkTimeFrame` and `refreshLives` functions in `src\views\page\index.jsx` are frequently updated, showing ongoing efforts to accurately display and refresh live stream data, merge API responses, and handle time-based content filtering. The `live_refresh_interval` variable's frequent changes and hardcoding also point to testing and tuning this live data refresh mechanism.
*   **Virtualization and Performance:** The `useVirtualizedRows` hook and its integration into `src\views\page\index.jsx` highlight a strategy to optimize rendering performance by only showing a subset of rows (virtualization). The repeated attempts to modify `setPageData` logic in `checkTimeFrame` and the introduction/removal of `syncVirtualizationWithData` further emphasize this focus on performance and efficient state updates, especially when the underlying data structure changes.
*   **Debugging and Testing:** Several changes, such as the temporary `setTimeout` for removing an item from `pageData.children` and the `useEffect` to simulate `fakeEntries` and item removal in `src\views\page\index.jsx`, suggest active debugging and testing of dynamic content changes and their impact on rendering and virtualization. The console logs (`ajsrConsole.log`, `console.log`) also serve debugging purposes.
*   **Platform Specific Adjustments:** Changes in `tizen.js` and `generic.js` show adaptations for specific Smart TV platforms (Tizen, WebOS, Hisense, HbbTV) regarding keyboard input handling, screen saver management, and application lifecycle events (`visibilitychange`).
*   **UI/UX Refinements:** Updates to `index.html` for player libraries and titles, addition of "Roboto" font, and `LiveItemHome` component enhancements (external content tags, logos, presenter info) indicate continuous improvement of the user interface and experience.
*   **Refactoring and State Management:** The evolution of how `pageData` is updated within `checkTimeFrame` (direct mutation of `homeDataRef.current` vs. creating `newData` objects and `setPageData(prev => ...)`) shows a progression towards more idiomatic React state management patterns, aiming for immutability and controlled re-renders.

## 10:19:41
The log details several changes across three files in the `3cat_smarttv` project, focusing primarily on `index.jsx` within the `src\views\page` directory, `index.html`, `App.jsx`, `tizen.js`, `playerLoader.jsx`, `generic.js`, `btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx`, `liveItemHome\index.jsx`, and `genericRow\index.jsx`.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx`** (20/2/2026, 12:11:57 - 24/2/2026, 14:44:26):
    *   **Live Refresh Interval:** Initially, `live_refresh_interval` was hardcoded to `3000` (then `10000`) and later reverted to using `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`. There were several intermediate changes where `live_refresh_interval` was explicitly set to `1000`, `2000`, and `6000000` (which is very long) before being restored to `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`.
    *   **Data Filtering and State Management:** Significant modifications were made to the `checkTimeFrame` function, which is responsible for updating live data and the `pageData` state.
        *   **Initial `checkTimeFrame` Logic:** Directly set `setPageData` with filtered children after updating `homeDataRef.current`.
        *   **Intermediate Changes (23/2/2026, 19:09:03):** Introduced more explicit state management for `setPageData` to handle initial renders (`!hasRefreshed.current`) vs. subsequent updates (only updating live rows if `livePositionsToUpdate` has entries). It aimed to prevent unnecessary full re-renders by creating new references only for changed live rows.
        *   **Further Refinements (23/2/2026, 23:31:18 - 24/2/2026, 0:10:46):** The logic within `checkTimeFrame` for updating `pageData` was frequently altered, with comments indicating attempts to debounce or control re-renders (e.g., introducing a `setInterval` to update `pageData` every 2 seconds, then removing it).
        *   **Simulated Row Removal (24/2/2026, 12:57:22 - 24/2/2026, 13:40:08):** A new `useEffect` hook was added to `Page` component to simulate dynamic row removal. This hook was set up to `splice(3, 1)` from `homeDataRef.current.children` every 10 seconds, effectively removing the 4th row (index 3). This was likely for testing dynamic content changes and virtualization. This logic was later commented out (24/2/2026, 14:36:17) or removed entirely, indicating it was a temporary test.
        *   **Virtualization Reset on Row Count Change (24/2/2026, 13:34:57 - 24/2/2026, 14:44:26):** The `checkTimeFrame` function was updated to detect changes in the number of children (`rowsChanged`). If the row count changes, it triggers `resetVirtualization()` and `removeVirtualizationState(location.pathname)` from `useVirtualizedRows` and navigates to the current path with `replace: true`, effectively forcing a full reset of the page's virtualization state and a re-render. This implies a focus on handling dynamic content changes that affect the number of rows.
        *   **`filterChildren` behavior:** A change was introduced to filter the 4th item (`index !== 3`) from the `children` array in some specific branches, likely for testing purposes.
    *   **`useEffect` Hooks:** The component's `useEffect` hooks also saw minor tweaks in initial states and cleanup.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html`** (20/2/2026, 12:16:22):
    *   **Player Library Updates:** The Shaka Player library was updated from `shaka-4-7-1.js` to `shaka.4.13.8.js`.
    *   **IMA SDK:** Google IMA SDK script (`ima3.js`) was added.
    *   **Debug Console:** Scripts for `purple-console.min.js` and custom `window.debug` functions (`ajsrConsole`) were present for logging.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx`** (20/2/2026, 12:16:57):
    *   **VirtualizationProvider:** The `VirtualizationProvider` context was introduced to wrap the `BrowserRouter`, indicating a new system for managing row virtualization state across the application.
    *   **Debug Information Display:** Added more conditions (`window.appConfig.test_app.show...`) to conditionally render build, user agent, version, platform, and player debug information.
    *   **Event Handling:** `window.AppGlobal.Actions.openCloseSessionModal` and `openExitAppModal` were linked to specific modal types for logout and exit functionalities.
    *   **User Logout Flow:** Modified the logout flow for kid users to dispatch `evChangeUser` and navigate to `/usersScreen` or `/home`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js`** (20/2/2026, 13:13:26):
    *   **Screen Saver Management:** Extensive logging and implementation for enabling/disabling the Tizen screen saver (`webapis.appcommon.setScreenSaver`) were added, and `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.status` is updated.
    *   **Player Actions on Visibility Change:** Added logic to pause the player when the app is hidden and play when resumed.
    *   **Network State Listener:** Implemented a listener for Tizen network state changes (`webapis.network.addNetworkStateChangeListener`) to dispatch `evNetworkDisconnected` and `evNetworkConnected` events.
    *   **Key Registration:** Registered additional Samsung TV remote keys (MediaPlay, MediaPause, etc., and numeric keys) for enhanced control.
    *   **App Launching and Store Integration:** Functions (`launchAppTizen`, `openSamsungStore`) for launching other Tizen applications and opening the Samsung App Store were introduced.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerLoader.jsx`** (20/2/2026, 18:52:39):
    *   **Subtitle Styles:** Added functions `setSubtitlesStyles` and `removeSubtitlesStyles` to dynamically apply CSS classes to the `cueContainer` based on user preferences (font size, background color, position).
    *   **Ad Tag URL Generation:** Updated logic for `vmapUrl` to use `build3catVmapUrl` and `getVmapParamsPlatform` for dynamically building ad tag URLs with platform-specific and GDPR parameters, replacing a previous approach that stripped query parameters.
    *   **Screen Saver Integration:** Added `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.disable()` on component mount and `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.enable()` on cleanup.
    *   **Buffering Indicator:** Integrated `window.BufferingIndicator.show()` and `hide()` calls to manage a buffering UI.
    *   **Autoplay/Time Marker Logic:** Refined the logic for `creditsMarkerIndex` to handle `autoplay` and `relatedData` availability, and to insert a default `credits` time marker if `autoplay` is enabled and `auto_next_episode_seconds` is configured.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js`** (20/2/2026, 18:58:23 - 20/2/2026, 19:25:16):
    *   **Keyboard Event Handling:** Changes focused on `onKeyDownHandler` to prevent default actions (`e.preventDefault()`, `e.stopPropagation()`) for certain key events. The `e.stopPropagation()` was initially present, then removed, then re-added for all keys, and finally removed from the general handler, only being present at the end of the `onKeyDownHandler` function, allowing some events to propagate initially.
    *   **Player Key Filtering:** Added a check `if (PLAYER_KEYS.has(keyCode) && (!window.AppGlobal.Player || !window.AppGlobal.Player.isReady))` to ignore player-related key presses if the player is not ready.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx`** (23/2/2026, 17:26:19 - 23/2/2026, 17:27:28):
    *   **Removed Interval:** An `setInterval` that called `refresh_LOCAL_FavoritesList()` every 3 seconds was removed from the initial `useEffect` hook. The `refresh_LOCAL_FavoritesList()` call now only occurs once on mount.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx`** (23/2/2026, 19:07:16):
    *   **Image Generation:** Updated `generateImageDataFromLiveChannelInHome_v2` to be used for image data.
    *   **External Content Display:** Enhanced handling of external content, including `platformLogo` and `icLinkExterior` icon, along with `isLiveExternal` and `whiteTagText` from `useExternalEmission` hook.
    *   **Focus Management:** Added `registerFocusAction` and `unregisterFocusAction` to manage focus for individual live items.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss`** (23/2/2026, 12:40:42):
    *   **Font Definitions:** This file solely defines `@font-face` rules for "Bw 3Cat" and "Roboto" fonts, including various weights and styles, using both `.ttf` and `.woff` formats. It also sets the `body` font to "Bw 3Cat".

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx`** (24/2/2026, 10:52:48 - 24/2/2026, 14:18:59):
    *   **`handleRowNavigation` Logic:** The `handleRowNavigation` function was modified to properly handle wrapping from the last row to the first when navigating "down". The logic for calculating `newVisibleRows` and adjusting `accumulatedTop` based on window changes was refined.
    *   **Virtualization State Management:** The `saveVirtualization` and `removeVirtualizationState` functions ensure that the state of visible rows, scroll positions, and focused element IDs is stored and retrieved per page, preventing loss of context upon navigation.
    *   **`syncVirtualizationWithData` removal:** The `syncVirtualizationWithData` function was added as a prop in `page/index.jsx` but was not implemented or exported from `useVirtualizedRows.jsx` (24/2/2026, 14:15:20), indicating a potential half-implemented feature or a change in approach. Later it was removed as a prop from the `Page` component.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx`** (24/2/2026, 20:47:55):
    *   **Row Element Mapping:** Added `LIVE_TV` to map to `LiveItemHome` in `getRowElement` for live content.
    *   **Show All Elements Focus Shape:** Updated `getShowAllElementsFocusShape` to include 'keyframe' for `LIVE_TV` and `LAST_DAYS`.
    *   **`onFocusAction` Handling:** Modified `onFocusAction` logic within the mapped `RowElement` to prevent `teasers` from being passed when not needed and to handle `null` for `FEATURED` and `INLINE` row types.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Focus Management:** There's a strong emphasis on consistent focus management across various components (`Page`, `LiveItemHome`, `GenericRow`) using a global `nav` object (`nav.focusById`, `nav.move.up/down/left/right`, `nav.action`, `nav.fixedFocus.isNavigating`) and event listeners for custom navigation (`customNavigation`). This suggests a UI designed for remote control interaction on smart TVs.
*   **Virtualization:** The introduction and refinement of `useVirtualizedRows` and `VirtualizationContext` indicate an effort to optimize performance for pages with many rows of content by rendering only visible elements and preserving scroll state across navigations.
*   **Live Content Handling:** The `Page` component frequently updates `live_refresh_interval` and implements intricate logic within `checkTimeFrame`, `mergeData`, `getNowPlayingSelectorData`, and `refreshLives` to dynamically fetch and update "Now Playing" and live stream data. This involves merging API data, filtering based on timeframes, and updating the UI with minimal re-renders.
*   **Platform-Specific Logic:** The codebase includes explicit checks for `window.AppGlobal.platform` (e.g., `'hbbtv'`, `'webos'`, `'tizen'`) to apply platform-specific behaviors, such as filtering content or handling key events.
*   **Context API Usage:** Heavy reliance on React Contexts (`AuthContext`, `OptionsContext`, `SettingsContext`, `SitecatalystContext`, `CapabilitiesContext`, `VirtualizationContext`, `HighlightContext`, `BroadcastContext`, `HistoryContext`, `DidomiContext`, `ParentalControlContext`, `TextsContext`) suggests a robust state management architecture.
*   **Error Handling and Authentication:** API calls often include error callbacks that handle "Unauthorized" or "Token expired" messages by redirecting to authentication screens or logging out the user.
*   **Debugging and Logging:** Extensive `ajsrConsole.log` and `console.log` statements are present across many files, along with debug panels and functions in `App.jsx` and `tizen.js`, indicating an active development and debugging phase.
*   **Font Inclusion:** A dedicated `fonts.scss` file is used to define custom fonts (`Bw 3Cat` and `Roboto`) with various weights and formats, ensuring consistent typography.
*   **Dynamic UI Updates:** The `Page` component's `checkTimeFrame` function, and its numerous iterations, show a pattern of attempting to update the UI efficiently for live data changes, initially by full state updates and later by more granular updates to avoid unnecessary re-renders. The introduction and removal of `splice(3,1)` for rows indicates testing of content that might disappear or appear dynamically, further pushing the need for robust virtualization logic.
*   **Styling:** SCSS files (`styles.scss`, `styles.kids.scss`, `playerLoader.scss`, `stylesLive.scss`, `stylesVod.scss`, `cueContainer.scss`, `index.scss`, `row.scss`) are consistently used for component styling, often with separate files for "kids" profiles.

## 11:19:42
The provided logs capture a series of code changes within a Smart TV application, primarily focusing on `index.jsx` files for page views and core platform logic, along with updates to a `useVirtualizedRows` hook and a `btnFavoriteMemory` component.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (20/2/2026, 12:11:57 - 24/2/2026, 14:44:26)**: This file, representing a page view component, underwent numerous iterations.
    *   **Initial Change (20/2/2026, 12:11:57):** The file was modified to set `live_refresh_interval` to `3000`.
    *   **Subsequent Changes (20/2/2026, 12:12:08 - 23/2/2026, 16:50:06):** The `live_refresh_interval` was repeatedly adjusted, toggling between `3000` (commented out in some cases) and `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`. This indicates testing or adjustments to the live data refresh rate.
    *   **Significant Refactoring in `checkTimeFrame` function (23/2/2026, 19:09:03):** The `checkTimeFrame` function was substantially rewritten to improve how live data updates are handled.
        *   It now uses a `Set` (`livePositionsToUpdate`) to track which rows need updating.
        *   It explicitly avoids direct mutation of `homeDataRef.current` by creating `updatedRow` objects for live content and `newSliderChildren` for the slider row.
        *   It introduces a conditional rendering strategy: a full `setPageData` call on the first refresh (`!hasRefreshed.current`) and selective updates for live rows on subsequent refreshes to optimize re-renders.
    *   **Further Refinements to `checkTimeFrame` and `setPageData` (23/2/2026, 23:31:18 - 24/2/2026, 0:14:17):**
        *   Initial attempts to introduce a `setInterval` within `checkTimeFrame` to force `setPageData` every 2 seconds (`23/2/2026, 23:33:59`) were reverted.
        *   The logic for `setPageData` in `checkTimeFrame` was simplified, removing the `hasRefreshed.current` conditional and the separate update logic for live rows, reverting to a full `setPageData` call with filtered children (`24/2/2026, 0:10:46`).
        *   Experimentation with removing the 3rd item from filtered children (`c.filter((_, index) => index !== 3)`) was observed across several timestamps (e.g., `24/2/2026, 12:57:22`, `24/2/2026, 13:00:39`, `24/2/2026, 13:03:18`). This was temporary and eventually removed.
        *   The `checkTimeFrame` logic was updated again to include logic for `prevCount` and `newCount` of children to detect changes in row numbers and conditionally call `resetVirtualization()` and `navigate(location.pathname, { replace: true })` to handle layout changes, suggesting issues with dynamic row additions/removals and virtualization state (`24/2/2026, 13:34:57` onwards).
    *   **Introduction of a separate `useEffect` for interval-based data manipulation (24/2/2026, 13:40:08):** A new `useEffect` hook was added to `Page` to simulate data changes at a 10-second interval, including the removal of the 3rd item (index 3) from `homeDataRef.current.children`, to test dynamic list updates. This change was short-lived and reverted.
    *   **Final `checkTimeFrame` refinements (24/2/2026, 14:15:20 - 24/2/2026, 14:44:26):** The `checkTimeFrame` function was consistently updated to filter `newChildren` by splicing the 3rd item if `hasRefreshed.current` is true, indicating ongoing testing of dynamic content removal. The logic around `resetVirtualization` and navigation upon row count changes was also refined.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html` (20/2/2026, 12:16:22):**
    *   Updated the Shaka Player library version from `shaka-4-7-1.js` to `shaka.4.13.8.js`.
    *   Added `<script src="https://imasdk.googleapis.com/js/sdkloader/ima3.js"></script>` for IMA SDK integration, indicating potential ad functionality.
    *   Removed `e.stopPropagation()` from the `onKeyDownHandler`, which suggests a change in how keyboard events are handled across the application, allowing events to propagate further.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (20/2/2026, 12:16:57):**
    *   Updated `BrowserRouter` with `future={{v7_startTransition: true, v7_relativeSplatPath: true}}`, likely to prepare for or utilize new React Router v7 features.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (20/2/2026, 13:13:26):**
    *   New console logs were added for Tizen platform initialization and error handling (`ajsrConsole.log`, `debugTizenAppCommon`, `console.error`).
    *   Enhanced error handling for screen saver settings (`webapis.appcommon.setScreenSaver`).
    *   Updated `initExtraSamsungKeys` to include numeric keys '0'-'9' and channel navigation keys ('ChannelDown', 'ChannelUp') for Samsung Tizen TV remote control.
    *   `launchAppTizen` and `openSamsungStore` functions were added, indicating support for launching other applications and the Samsung store, along with improved error handling for these actions.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerLoader.jsx` (20/2/2026, 18:52:39):**
    *   Major refactoring in ads handling within `getStreamData`: previous logic of stripping query parameters from `vmapUrl` was replaced with new logic to dynamically build the `vmapUrl` using `build3catVmapUrl` and `getVmapParamsPlatform`, addressing macros (`__platform__`, `__gdpr__`, etc.).
    *   Added `window.BufferingIndicator.show()` and `hide()` calls within `useEffect` for better buffering indication.
    *   Added calls to `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.disable()` and `enable()` for managing the screen saver during player activity.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (20/2/2026, 18:58:23 - 20/2/2026, 19:25:16):**
    *   The `onKeyDownHandler` function was modified across several commits.
    *   Initially, `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` were commented out (`20/2/2026, 18:58:23`), but then re-added (`20/2/2026, 19:05:58`).
    *   `e.stopPropagation()` was later commented out again (`20/2/2026, 19:15:17`), then re-added at the end of the `onKeyDownHandler` function (`20/2/2026, 19:21:43`), and finally removed from the end of the function (`20/2/2026, 19:25:16`). This indicates active debugging and refinement of event propagation for keyboard events.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss` (23/2/2026, 12:40:42):**
    *   Updated font definitions for "Bw 3Cat" and "Roboto" to include both `truetype` (`.ttf`) and `woff` formats, ensuring broader browser compatibility and potentially better performance.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 17:26:19 - 23/2/2026, 17:27:28):**
    *   An `setInterval` to refresh local favorites every 3 seconds was removed from the initial `useEffect` hook (`23/2/2026, 17:27:28`), indicating a change in how favorite status updates are triggered.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 19:07:16):**
    *   The component was updated to handle external live content, including showing external platform logos and specific tags (`live`, `upcoming`).
    *   Introduced `isLiveExternal` and `whiteTagText` from `useExternalEmission` hook.
    *   The `navFixedFocusShape` now conditionally includes `external-content`.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx` (24/2/2026, 10:52:48 - 24/2/2026, 14:18:59):**
    *   **Refinement of `handleRowNavigation` (24/2/2026, 10:56:20):** Improved vertical virtualization logic by adding a "wrap" feature when navigating down from the last row to the first, and adjusting `accumulatedTop` only when the visible window's start index changes. This ensures smoother scrolling transitions.
    *   **Addition of `syncVirtualizationWithData` (24/2/2026, 14:18:41):** A new function `syncVirtualizationWithData` was added to the hook's return, intended to synchronize virtualization state with data changes, though its implementation is not shown here. This indicates a focus on addressing virtualization issues when the underlying data array changes its length dynamically. It was then removed again from the return object (`24/2/2026, 14:18:59`), suggesting a change of approach.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (24/2/2026, 20:47:55):**
    *   Introduced new `RowElement` types: `HeroItem`, `LiveItemHome`, `LastDayItem`, and `LandscapeProgressBarItem`.
    *   The `getRowElement` and `getShowAllElementsFocusShape` functions were updated to include logic for these new row types.
    *   The `generateShowAllElements` function was refactored to use `useEffect` for focus actions and to correctly handle `data-group-restore-last-focused` and `data-block-focus-down` attributes.
    *   `HeroItem` now explicitly pushes `rowData` if `rowItems` is empty.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **20/2/2026, 12:11:57 - 12:12:08:** Initial commit/minor adjustment to `live_refresh_interval` in `index.jsx` (page view).
*   **20/2/2026, 12:16:22:** Critical update to `index.html` (Shaka Player upgrade, IMA SDK addition).
*   **20/2/2026, 13:13:26:** Substantial updates to `tizen.js` for platform-specific functionalities (network listener, app launching, key handling, screen saver).
*   **20/2/2026, 18:52:39:** Key changes in `playerLoader.jsx` for ad URL handling and buffering/screensaver integration.
*   **23/2/2026, 19:09:03:** Major refactoring of `checkTimeFrame` in `index.jsx` (page view) to improve live data updates and re-render efficiency.
*   **24/2/2026, 10:56:20:** Significant improvement in `useVirtualizedRows` hook for vertical navigation and row wrapping logic.
*   **24/2/2026, 14:17:47:** Further attempt to integrate `resetVirtualization` and `removeVirtualizationState` into `checkTimeFrame` for dynamic row changes in `index.jsx` (page view), followed by removal of `syncVirtualizationWithData` from `useVirtualizedRows` (`24/2/2026, 14:18:59`) and a final stable version in `index.jsx` (`24/2/2026, 14:44:26`).
*   **24/2/2026, 20:47:55:** Extensive updates to `genericRow/index.jsx` to support new row item types and improved focus handling.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Live Content Refresh (`live_refresh_interval`):** The `live_refresh_interval` variable in `src\views\page\index.jsx` is a recurring point of modification, initially hardcoded and later configured via `settingsData`, indicating ongoing tuning of live content update frequency. The implementation of `refreshLives` and `checkTimeFrame` functions is central to this, involving fetching "Now Playing" data and dynamically updating content based on timeframes.
*   **Virtualization Management:** The `useVirtualizedRows` hook and related functions (`removeVirtualizationState`, `resetVirtualization`) are consistently used across components, particularly `src\views\page\index.jsx`, indicating a strong emphasis on optimizing performance for pages with many rows. There's a pattern of saving and restoring virtualization state to `VirtualizationContext`.
*   **Dynamic UI Updates and Re-rendering Optimization:** There's a clear effort to optimize re-rendering, especially for live data. Early attempts involved full `setPageData` calls, evolving to more granular updates (e.g., using `livePositionsToUpdate` in `index.jsx`). Later changes in `index.jsx` and `useVirtualizedRows` show a struggle to reconcile virtualization state with dynamic changes in the number of rows, often resorting to full resets or navigation to handle data structure changes.
*   **Platform-Specific Adaptations:** The `src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` and `src\platform\generic.js` files demonstrate a consistent need to adapt keyboard input and system behaviors (like screen savers, app launching) to different Smart TV platforms (Tizen, WebOS, HBBTV, generic HTML5). This includes registering specific key codes and handling `visibilitychange` events.
*   **Ad Integration:** The `playerLoader.jsx` file highlights recurring tasks related to advertisement integration, specifically managing `vmapUrl` for VOD ads, including macro replacement for platform-specific parameters.
*   **Debugging and Testing:** Frequent changes to console logs (`ajsrConsole.log`, `console.log`) and temporary code snippets (like `setInterval` for testing row removal in `index.jsx`) indicate active debugging and testing phases during development.
*   **Context API Usage:** The widespread use of React Contexts (e.g., `AuthContext`, `OptionsContext`, `SettingsContext`, `SitecatalystContext`, `CapabilitiesContext`, `HighlightContext`, `VirtualizationContext`) is a dominant pattern for state management and sharing application-wide settings and data.

## 12:19:41
The provided logs indicate frequent modifications across several JavaScript and HTML files within a `3cat_smarttv` project, specifically focusing on view components, platform-specific logic, and a core application file.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (20/2/2026, then frequent changes on 23/2/2026 and 24/2/2026):**
    *   **Initial Refinement (20/2/2026):** A minor adjustment to the `live_refresh_interval` variable was made, changing it from `3000` to `10000` (then commented out `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000;`).
    *   **Live Data Handling Refinements (23/2/2026 - 23:36:38):** The `checkTimeFrame` function, responsible for updating live content, underwent several iterations.
        *   Early changes involved attempts to prevent unnecessary `setPageData` calls by introducing a `hasRefreshed` ref and directly modifying `homeDataRef.current` before a single `setPageData` call.
        *   A significant change introduced logic to selectively update `pageData` by checking if `livePositionsToUpdate` had any entries, aiming for more performant updates (23/2/2026, 19:09:03). This version used `setPageData` with a `prev` state to conditionally update rows.
        *   Later changes (23/2/2026, 23:31:18 to 23:51:49) reverted or modified the selective update logic back to a simpler `setPageData` call, reintroducing an `setInterval` call within `checkTimeFrame` at one point (23/2/2026, 23:33:59), which was then removed.
        *   The `live_refresh_interval` was temporarily set to `3000` and `2000` for testing before reverting to `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`.
    *   **Virtualized Row Integration and State Management (24/2/2026):** Extensive changes were made around how `pageData` updates interact with the `useVirtualizedRows` hook.
        *   Attempts were made to `splice(3, 1)` from `newChildren` under certain conditions (`hasRefreshed.current` is true), suggesting testing dynamic row removal. This was present in multiple commits and later commented out (24/2/2026, 14:36:17).
        *   The `setPageData` callback logic was refined to handle cases where the number of children rows changes (`prev.children.length != newChildren.length`). If a change in row count is detected, it triggers `resetVirtualization()`, `removeVirtualizationState(location.pathname)`, `resetFixedFocus()`, and a `navigate(location.pathname, { replace: true })`, indicating a full reset and re-navigation to reinitialize the page's virtualization state. This pattern appears frequently from 24/2/2026, 14:17:47 onwards.
        *   A `setTimeout` was temporarily introduced in `checkTimeFrame` (24/2/2026, 13:07:23) to filter children after a delay, and later replaced with a `useEffect` that simulates dynamic row removal (24/2/2026, 13:40:08). This simulated removal also triggered the virtualization reset logic.
    *   **Variable Renaming and Import Cleanup (24/2/2026, 13:10:49):** Imports were reformatted to use double quotes and single imports for multiple items from the same module, and some parameters in `checkTimeFrame` were slightly adjusted.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html` (20/2/2026, 12:16:22):**
    *   Updated the Shaka Player library version from `shaka-4-7-1.js` to `shaka.4.13.8.js`.
    *   Removed commented-out lines related to older Shaka Player and VTT.js.
    *   Added a `<script>` tag for `https://imasdk.googleapis.com/js/sdkloader/ima3.js`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (20/2/2026, 12:16:57):**
    *   The `BrowserRouter` component was updated to include new `future` props: `v7_startTransition: true, v7_relativeSplatPath: true`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (20/2/2026, 13:13:26):**
    *   Added logging for device model and manufacturer info during app initialization.
    *   Included console logs for debugging `webapis.appcommon` functionalities.
    *   Introduced `webapis.avplay.stop()` during app hiding to ensure video playback stops on Tizen.
    *   Added new `initNetworkStateListener` to dispatch `evNetworkDisconnected` and `evNetworkConnected` events.
    *   Expanded the `initExtraSamsungKeys` function to register a wider range of keys for Samsung TV remotes (e.g., numeric keys, channel up/down, color keys).
    *   Modified `openSamsungStore` error handling to open a search if store detail fails.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerLoader.jsx` (20/2/2026, 18:52:39):**
    *   Removed the `stripQuery` helper function.
    *   Updated ad VMAP URL handling to dynamically build the `vmapUrl` using `build3catVmapUrl` and `getVmapParamsPlatform`, replacing macros with real values, instead of merely stripping query parameters.
    *   Integrated screen saver disable/enable calls (`window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.disable()` and `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.enable()`) into the `useEffect` hook for player lifecycle management.
    *   Added `window.BufferingIndicator.show()` and `hide()` calls around player setup.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (Frequent changes between 20/2/2026, 18:58:23 and 20/2/2026, 19:25:16):**
    *   The `onKeyDownHandler` function was modified.
    *   Initially, `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` were commented out (20/2/2026, 18:58:23).
    *   These lines were then uncommented (20/2/2026, 19:05:58), indicating a change in event handling behavior to prevent default browser/platform actions and stop event propagation.
    *   `e.stopPropagation()` was later moved to the end of the `onKeyDownHandler` function (20/2/2026, 19:21:43), suggesting a more granular control over event flow after specific key actions are processed. However, by 20/2/2026, 19:25:16, it was back to being called directly after `e.preventDefault()` (or removed entirely as a separate line, being part of the same logic block).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss` (23/2/2026, 12:40:42):**
    *   Added `woff` font formats for "Bw 3Cat" font family, specifically `bw3cat-black.woff`, `bw3cat-bold.woff`, `bw3cat-medium.woff`, `bw3cat-regular.woff`, and `bw3cat-thin.woff`. This provides broader browser support for these custom fonts.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 17:26:19 to 17:27:28):**
    *   Removed an `setInterval` call from the initial `useEffect` hook that was refreshing the local favorites list every 3 seconds. The `refresh_LOCAL_FavoritesList` is now called once on component mount.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 19:07:16):**
    *   Updated how the `navFixedFocusShape` is determined, now conditionally adding `external-content` if `isExternal` is true.
    *   Modified the `onFocusAction` callback within `useEffect` to ensure it only triggers if `origin` is not 'mouse'.
    *   Adjusted the `onMouseOver` event handler to explicitly focus by ID and then call `onFocusAction` (passing null).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx` (24/2/2026, 10:52:48 to 14:18:59):**
    *   The `handleRowNavigation` function was significantly refactored.
        *   Introduced a wrap-around logic for "down" navigation: if at the last row, it wraps to row 0, resetting `accumulatedTranslate`, `accumulatedTop`, and `visibleRows`.
        *   Refined the logic for adjusting `accumulatedTop` only when the `start` index of `newVisibleRows` changes from `oldStart`.
        *   The `syncVirtualizationWithData` function was added to the export list in an intermediate commit (24/2/2026, 14:18:41) but was not fully implemented in `index.jsx` or subsequently removed from the export list (24/2/2026, 14:18:59), suggesting it was either a temporary or an incomplete feature.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (24/2/2026, 20:47:55):**
    *   Modified the `onFocusAction` parameter for `RowElement` (inside `rowItems.map`) to pass `item` only if `rowType` is not 'FEATURED' or 'INLINE', otherwise `null`.
    *   Updated the `onBlurAction` for `RowElement` to set `teasers: null` and `dismissFadeIn: true` on the item, along with general cleanup.
    *   Added a `console.warn` for missing `onFocusAction` in `GenericRow`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Live Data Refresh Logic:** The `checkTimeFrame` and `refreshLives` functions in `src\views\page\index.jsx` are central to updating live program data. There's a recurring pattern of fetching "Now Playing" data (`ApiGetNowPlaying`, `ApiGetNowPlayingSelector`), merging it with existing `homeDataRef.current`, and then updating `pageData`. This logic is often tied to an `setInterval` for periodic updates.
2.  **Virtualization State Management:** The `useVirtualizedRows` hook, extensively used in `src\views\page\index.jsx`, focuses on optimizing rendering by managing `visibleRows`, `accumulatedTranslate`, `accumulatedTop`, `currentRow`, and `rowXTranslatePos`. There's a consistent effort to `saveVirtualization` and `removeVirtualizationState` based on page navigation and component lifecycle. The `resetVirtualization` function is frequently called when major data or structural changes occur.
3.  **HbbTV Platform Specifics:** Throughout `src\views\page\index.jsx`, `filterChildren` includes logic specifically for the `hbbtv` platform, filtering out items with external content.
4.  **User Type Based Content (Kids/Adults):** In `src\views\page\index.jsx`, the `getHomeData` function dynamically selects `homeId` based on `activeUser?.type === UserType.KID`, demonstrating a recurring pattern of adapting content for different user profiles.
5.  **Error Handling for Unauthorized/Expired Tokens:** API calls in `src\views\page\index.jsx` consistently include error handling to check for "Unauthorized" or "Token expired" messages, triggering navigation to `/qrAuthScreen` or `logout()`.
6.  **Global AppState/Actions (`window.AppGlobal`):** Several files interact with a global `window.AppGlobal` object, specifically for `Slider` state (`wasSliderRowRendered`), `ApiMemory`, `Actions` (like `openExitAppModal`, `onVisibilityChange`), `Player` actions, `platform`, and `ScreenSaver` status. This suggests a central control mechanism for application-wide functionalities.
7.  **Keyboard Navigation (`nav` object and `onKeyDownHandler`):** `src\platform\generic.js` and `src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx` show a strong focus on keyboard-driven navigation (`nav.move.up()`, `nav.action()`, `nav.focusById()`) and platform-specific key code handling for Smart TVs (WebOS, Tizen). `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` are frequently toggled or repositioned in `onKeyDownHandler`, indicating ongoing adjustments to event handling.
8.  **Font Management:** The `src\fonts.scss` file shows a standard pattern of defining `@font-face` rules for multiple font weights and styles, ensuring consistent typography across the application.
9.  **Debug Logging (`ajsrConsole`):** There are many `ajsrConsole.log` calls throughout the code, especially in platform-specific files (`tizen.js`, `generic.js`), indicating a robust internal debugging system.

**Significant Timestamps:**

*   **20/2/2026, 12:11:57 - 12:12:08:** Minor adjustment to `live_refresh_interval` in `index.jsx`.
*   **20/2/2026, 12:16:22:** Major update to `index.html`, including a Shaka Player version bump and IMA SDK inclusion.
*   **20/2/2026, 12:16:57:** `App.jsx` updated with new `BrowserRouter` future props.
*   **20/2/2026, 13:13:26:** Substantial platform-specific updates in `tizen.js` for device info, event listeners, network state, and key registration.
*   **20/2/2026, 18:52:39:** `playerLoader.jsx` modified for ad VMAP URL processing and screen saver integration with player lifecycle.
*   **20/2/2026, 19:05:58:** `src\platform\generic.js` changes to re-enable `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` for keyboard events.
*   **23/2/2026, 19:09:03:** A notable refinement in `src\views\page\index.jsx` for `checkTimeFrame` to optimize live content updates by selectively updating only changed live rows. This indicates a focus on performance.
*   **24/2/2026, 10:52:48 - 10:56:20:** Key refactoring in `useVirtualizedRows.jsx` for row navigation, including wrap-around logic and refined `accumulatedTop` calculation.
*   **24/2/2026, 14:17:47 onwards (multiple timestamps):** Frequent changes in `src\views\page\index.jsx` related to handling `pageData` updates, especially when row counts change, leading to `resetVirtualization` and re-navigation. This suggests ongoing debugging and refinement of dynamic content loading and display.

## 16:43:33
The provided log details changes across several files, primarily focusing on updates to the `Page` component logic in `index.jsx`, `useVirtualizedRows` hook, `App.jsx`, `index.html`, `generic.js`, `tizen.js`, `playerLoader.jsx`, `btnFavoriteMemory/index.jsx`, and `liveItemHome/index.jsx`.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (20/2/2026, 12:11:57 - 24/2/2026, 14:44:26)**:
    *   **Live Refresh Interval**: Initially, `live_refresh_interval` was hardcoded to `3000` (commented out `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`). It was then changed to `10000` (commented out `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`), then reverted to use `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`. There were several instances where it was briefly set to `3000`, `2000`, and `1000`, or a large value like `6000000` (6000 seconds / 100 minutes) for debugging purposes, before consistently returning to `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000` or a hardcoded `10000`.
    *   **State Management in `checkTimeFrame`**: Significant changes were made to how `pageData` is updated within the `checkTimeFrame` function.
        *   Initially, `setPageData` was called directly with the new data.
        *   Later, `homeDataRef.current` was mutated directly, and `setPageData` was commented out or updated using a `newData` variable.
        *   An attempt to differentiate updates based on `hasRefreshed.current` was introduced, where the first refresh would call `setPageData` and subsequent refreshes would only update specific live rows (using `livePositionsToUpdate` and `setPageData` with a `prev` state callback) to avoid unnecessary re-renders. This more granular update logic was then removed, reverting to a full `setPageData` call.
        *   Multiple debugging attempts involved introducing `setInterval` or `setTimeout` calls within `checkTimeFrame` to simulate data changes (e.g., removing item at index 3) and observe re-rendering behavior. These temporary changes were subsequently removed.
        *   The logic for re-initializing virtualization (calling `resetVirtualization()` and `removeVirtualizationState()` and `navigate(location.pathname, { replace: true })`) was added to `setPageData` callback when `prev.children.length` differs from `newChildren.length`. This implies a re-initialization of the page's UI state upon significant data structure changes.
    *   **`useEffect` for Refresh Interval**: A new `useEffect` hook was temporarily introduced (24/2/2026, 13:40:08) to simulate `homeDataRef.current` changes and trigger `checkTimeFrame` at a `10000ms` interval, including a temporary `splice(3, 1)` to remove a row for testing purposes. This was later removed.
    *   **`filterChildren` function**: The `filterChildren` function consistently filters out slider items if `isLiveSupportedRef.current` is false, and removes items without children, live rows if live is not supported, "CANALS TEMÀTICS" if Shaka Player is not supported, and user rows for kid users. A temporary `splice(3, 1)` was added directly into `newChildren` before setting `pageData` during some debugging.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html` (20/2/2026, 12:16:22)**:
    *   Updated the Shaka Player library from `shaka-4-7-1.js` to `shaka.4.13.8.js`.
    *   Added `https://imasdk.googleapis.com/js/sdkloader/ima3.js` for IMA SDK.
    *   Includes various vendor scripts for analytics (VisitorAPI, Omniture, Comscore), streaming (springstreams), and utility (underscore, easy.qrcode).
    *   Defined global debug functions (`window.debug`, `window.ajsrConsole`).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (20/2/2026, 12:16:57)**:
    *   Initialized `InitDevConsole` and `Platform.initPlatform()`, `Platform.initKeyboard()` within `useEffect` hooks.
    *   Configured various debug display options through `BuildInfo` component, showing environment, user agent, versions, platform, OS, resolutions, and player/ads info based on `window.appConfig.test_app` settings.
    *   Added event listeners for `openExitAppModal` and `openCloseSessionModal` to `window.AppGlobal.Actions`.
    *   Added a new `VideoSpinner` component.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (20/2/2026, 13:13:26)**:
    *   Updated `initAppTizen` to use `ajsrConsole` for logging and to register an event listener for `visibilitychange` to pause/play media and manage history, and for `evExitApplication` to exit the Tizen application.
    *   Added `initNetworkStateListener` to dispatch `evNetworkDisconnected` and `evNetworkConnected` events.
    *   `hasTizenAppCommon` and `debugTizenAppCommon` functions were added for checking and logging `webapis.appcommon` functionality.
    *   `initScreenSaverHelpers` was introduced to manage screen saver state (enable/disable) via `webapis.appcommon.setScreenSaver`.
    *   `initExtraSamsungKeys` registers media and numeric keys for Samsung TV Remote.
    *   `launchAppTizen` and `openSamsungStore` functions were added for launching other Tizen applications and opening the Samsung App Store.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerLoader.jsx` (20/2/2026, 18:52:39)**:
    *   Enhanced ad handling logic: the `vmapUrl` processing changed from simply stripping query parameters to using `build3catVmapUrl` for replacing macros with real values, and sharing it globally via `window._currentVODAdTagUrl`.
    *   Improved subtitle styling: `setSubtitlesStyles` and `removeSubtitlesStyles` functions were added to manage font size, background color, and position of subtitles dynamically based on `optionsProvider`.
    *   Introduced `window.BufferingIndicator.show()` and `window.BufferingIndicator.hide()` for showing/hiding a buffering indicator.
    *   Screen saver is disabled on player start and re-enabled on cleanup.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (20/2/2026, 18:58:23 - 20/2/2026, 19:25:16)**:
    *   Modified the `onKeyDownHandler` function:
        *   Initially, `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` were commented out. They were uncommented in subsequent commits (19:05:58) but `e.stopPropagation()` was later commented out again (19:15:17) and then re-added at the end of the `onKeyDownHandler` (19:21:43) and then removed again (19:25:16). This indicates iterative adjustments to event handling for keyboard navigation.
        *   Added a check to ignore player keys (`PLAYER_KEYS`) if the player is not ready.
        *   Refined the `VK_BACK` key handling to specifically check for `window.displayingDidomi` and `window.isUserModalVisible` before calling `goBackHistory` or `openExitAppModal`.
        *   Added debug key bindings (keys '1', '2', '3') for enabling/disabling ads and displaying build number.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 17:26:19 - 23/2/2026, 17:27:28)**:
    *   Removed a `setInterval` call from the initial `useEffect` hook, streamlining the favorite status refresh. The `refresh_LOCAL_FavoritesList` is now called once on mount and when `item` changes.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss` (23/2/2026, 12:40:42)**:
    *   Added new `@font-face` rules for "Bw 3Cat" font in both `.ttf` and `.woff` formats, covering various weights (Black, Bold, Dotted, Heavy, Light, Medium, Regular, Rounded, Thin).
    *   Added `@font-face` rules for "Roboto" font in `.ttf` format, covering various weights.
    *   Set the default `body` font to "Bw 3Cat", with a fallback to `sans-serif`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 19:07:16)**:
    *   Refactored the `LiveItemHome` component to use `React.memo` for performance optimization.
    *   Added `useExternalEmission` hook to determine `isLiveExternal` and `whiteTagText`.
    *   Updated image generation logic (`generateImageDataFromLiveChannelInHome_v2`) and channel logo retrieval.
    *   Introduced new styling classes (`external-content`, `platform-footer`, `platform-logo`, `platform-icon`, `tag live`, `tag upcoming`).
    *   Conditional rendering for external content (platform logo, external link icon, live/upcoming tags).
    *   Adjusted title rendering logic to filter null values and join with ' - '.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx` (24/2/2026, 10:52:48 - 24/2/2026, 14:18:59)**:
    *   **Row Navigation Logic**: The `handleRowNavigation` useCallback was modified to correctly wrap around to the first row when navigating down from the last row, and to recalculate `visibleRows` and `accumulatedTop` based on the new `currentRow`.
    *   **Synchronization of Virtualization State**: The `syncVirtualizationWithData` function was added to explicitly handle scenarios where the underlying data (`pageData.children`) changes in length, potentially invalidating current virtualization state. This function was initially introduced to `Page` component to reset virtualization (24/2/2026, 14:06:51) and then removed as part of `useVirtualizedRows` changes (24/2/2026, 14:15:20). It was later noted that the `resetVirtualization` and `removeVirtualizationState` calls were used directly in `Page` component.
    *   **`prevPageId` Reference**: A `prevPageId` ref was added to detect changes in `pageId` and trigger a `removePageState` and `resetVirtualization` accordingly. This ensures that when navigating to a new page, the virtualization state for the old page is cleared.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (24/2/2026, 20:47:55)**:
    *   Imported `LiveItemHome` and `LastDayItem` components.
    *   Expanded `getRowElement` to include `LIVE_TV` and `LAST_DAYS` row types, mapping them to `LiveItemHome` and `LastDayItem` respectively.
    *   Updated `getShowAllElementsFocusShape` to return 'keyframe' for 'LIVE_TV' and 'LAST_DAYS' row types.
    *   Adjusted `onFocusAction` for `GenericRow` to pass `null` for 'FEATURED' and 'INLINE' types, preventing unintended highlight panel updates.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

1.  **Iterative Refinement and Debugging in `Page/index.jsx`**: A significant portion of the changes are concentrated in `src\views\page\index.jsx`, indicating an ongoing process of optimizing data fetching, live content refreshing, and state management. The repeated changes to `live_refresh_interval` and `checkTimeFrame` function logic, including temporary `setInterval`/`setTimeout` and `splice` operations, point to active debugging and performance tuning efforts related to live data updates and virtualization.
2.  **Virtualization State Management**: The introduction and frequent modification of `useVirtualizedRows` and its integration with `Page/index.jsx` highlight a focus on efficient rendering of large lists of rows, especially when data changes dynamically. The goal is to optimize re-renders and maintain UI state (scroll position, focused item) across navigation.
3.  **Platform-Specific Adaptations**: There's a clear pattern of adapting the application for different Smart TV platforms (Tizen, WebOS, HbbTV, generic HTML5) evident in `generic.js` and `tizen.js`. This includes registering platform-specific keys, handling visibility changes, managing screen savers, and launching external applications.
4.  **UI/UX Enhancements**: Updates like improved subtitle styling in `playerLoader.jsx`, new font declarations in `fonts.scss`, and the refactoring of `LiveItemHome` for external content and better visual indicators suggest an ongoing effort to improve the visual presentation and user experience.
5.  **Focus Management**: The `FixedFocus` and `useFixedFocus` hooks, along with `registerFocusAction` and `unregisterFocusAction` in `liveItemHome/index.jsx` and `genericRow/index.jsx`, indicate a robust focus management system crucial for Smart TV applications navigated via remote controls.
6.  **Context API Usage**: The consistent use of React Contexts (e.g., `AuthContext`, `OptionsContext`, `SettingsContext`, `SitecatalystContext`, `CapabilitiesContext`, `HighlightContext`, `VirtualizationContext`) across multiple components (especially `Page.jsx` and `App.jsx`) demonstrates a strong reliance on global state management for application configuration, user preferences, and analytics.
7.  **Ad Integration**: The `index.html` and `playerLoader.jsx` changes related to `ima3.js` and `build3catVmapUrl` indicate an ongoing integration and refinement of ad delivery mechanisms.
