# Activity Summary for 28/2/2026

## 4:17:49
The provided log details changes across several files, primarily focusing on updates to the `src\views\page\index.jsx` component, `src\platform\generic.js` for keyboard navigation, and `src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx` for UI virtualization, with minor adjustments in `index.html`, `src\App.jsx`, `src\platform\tizen\tizen.js`, `src\player\playerLoader.jsx`, `src\fonts.scss`, `src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx`, and `src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx`.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (Frequent Changes: 20/2/2026 12:11:57 - 24/2/2026 14:44:26, 25/2/2026 11:20:38 - 25/2/2026 11:23:07)**
    *   **Initial Changes (20/2/2026 12:11:57 - 12:12:08):** A minor change in the `live_refresh_interval` from `3000` to `10000` was made, and then reverted to `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`. This indicates testing or adjustments to the live data refresh rate.
    *   **Refactoring `checkTimeFrame` and `setPageData` (23/2/2026 19:09:03):** The `checkTimeFrame` function was significantly refactored. It now uses a `Set` to track `livePositionsToUpdate`, and the `setPageData` logic was updated to differentiate between initial page load (`!hasRefreshed.current`) and subsequent live row updates, aiming for more efficient re-renders by only updating changed rows on subsequent refreshes. This change was then reverted and re-implemented in different ways.
    *   **Debugging `checkTimeFrame` (23/2/2026 23:31:18):** A `console.log(homeDataRef.current)` was added inside `checkTimeFrame`, suggesting debugging efforts.
    *   **Interval for `setPageData` (23/2/2026 23:33:59):** An `setInterval` was briefly introduced in `checkTimeFrame` to update `pageData` every 2 seconds, which was later removed. This likely points to attempts to control the rendering frequency for live data.
    *   **`live_refresh_interval` Adjustments (23/2/2026 23:39:38, 23/2/2026 23:58:29, 24/2/2026 0:00:35, 24/2/2026 0:00:58, 24/2/2026 0:01:26):** The `live_refresh_interval` was repeatedly toggled between a hardcoded `1000` or `2000` and the `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000` value, indicating experimentation with live refresh rates.
    *   **`setPageData` and `filterChildren` Logic Modifications (24/2/2026 0:04:01, 24/2/2026 0:06:46, 24/2/2026 0:08:59, 24/2/2026 12:55:28, 24/2/2026 12:56:38, 24/2/2026 12:57:22, 24/2/2026 13:00:39, 24/2/2026 13:03:18):** There were several iterations of logic within `checkTimeFrame` related to how `setPageData` is called and how `newChildren` (derived from `filterChildren`) is compared to `prev.children` to prevent unnecessary re-renders. A specific line `c = c.filter((_, index) => index !== 3);` was added and removed multiple times within `checkTimeFrame`, suggesting dynamic removal of a specific row (index 3), likely for testing purposes.
    *   **`live_refresh_interval` Increased and Interval for Row Removal (24/2/2026 13:10:49, 24/2/2026 13:10:59):** The `live_refresh_interval` was significantly increased to `6000000` (likely disabling the interval for debugging) while a `setTimeout` was introduced to dynamically remove a row (index 3) after 20 seconds. This indicates testing of dynamic row removal. This `setTimeout` was then removed.
    *   **Re-introduction of Row Removal Logic within `checkTimeFrame` (24/2/2026 13:43:58, 24/2/2026 13:45:08):** The `newChildren.splice(3, 1)` logic was re-added within `checkTimeFrame` conditional on `hasRefreshed.current`, implying a mechanism to remove a specific row after the initial load.
    *   **Virtualization Reset on Row Count Change (24/2/2026 13:46:15, 24/2/2026 14:17:47):** Logic was added to `setPageData` in `checkTimeFrame` to call `resetVirtualization()` and `removeVirtualizationState(location.pathname)` if `rowsChanged` is true, followed by navigating back to the current path. This ensures the virtualization state is correctly reset when the number of rows changes.
    *   **Reverted interval in `useEffect` (24/2/2026 13:40:08):** A `useEffect` block containing a `setInterval` that simulated changes and removed a row was added, then later removed. This was another attempt to test dynamic content changes and virtualization.
    *   **Final `setPageData` Update Logic (24/2/2026 14:39:42 - 24/2/2026 14:44:26, 25/2/2026 11:20:38 - 25/2/2026 11:23:07):** The conditional check for `prev && prev.children.length != newChildren.length` was consistently applied to trigger a full reset of virtualization and navigation when the number of rows changes, which is a key pattern for handling dynamic content in a virtualized list.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html` (20/2/2026 12:16:22)**
    *   Updated the Shaka Player version from `shaka-4-7-1.js` to `shaka.4.13.8.js`, indicating a player dependency upgrade.
    *   Cleaned up commented-out script tags for Shaka Player and vtt.js.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (20/2/2026 12:16:57)**
    *   Added `VideoSpinner` component import and usage, suggesting the addition of a loading indicator for video playback.
    *   Included a `BroadcastProvider` for HbbTV platforms, indicating platform-specific context management.
    *   Updated `BrowserRouter` with `future={{v7_startTransition: true, v7_relativeSplatPath: true}}`, preparing for future React Router v7 features.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (20/2/2026 13:13:26)**
    *   Added console logging for Tizen device information and visibility change events.
    *   Implemented `evExitApplication` event listener to gracefully exit the Tizen application.
    *   Introduced `initNetworkStateListener` to dispatch `evNetworkDisconnected` and `evNetworkConnected` events, improving network state handling.
    *   Enhanced `initExtraSamsungKeys` to register a wider range of Samsung TV remote keys, including numeric, media control, and color buttons.
    *   Added `launchAppTizen` and `openSamsungStore` functions, allowing the application to launch other Tizen apps or open the Samsung app store.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerLoader.jsx` (20/2/2026 18:52:39)**
    *   Improved ad URL handling by replacing a simple query strip with a `build3catVmapUrl` function for more robust macro replacement in VMAP URLs.
    *   Added `window.BufferingIndicator.show()` and `hide()` calls to manage a global buffering indicator.
    *   Implemented `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.disable()` and `enable()` for controlling screen saver behavior during playback.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (Frequent Changes: 20/2/2026 18:58:23 - 20/2/2026 19:25:16)**
    *   Modified keyboard event handling. Specifically, `e.preventDefault()` was commented out and then re-enabled, and `e.stopPropagation()` was commented out, re-enabled, and then moved to the end of the `onKeyDownHandler` function, indicating fine-tuning of event propagation control for keyboard inputs across different Smart TV platforms.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss` (23/2/2026 12:40:42)**
    *   Added new `@font-face` definitions for "Bw 3Cat" and "Roboto" fonts, including different weights and styles, and specified both TTF and WOFF formats for "Bw 3Cat." The `body` element was updated to use "Bw 3Cat" as the primary font.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx` (23/2/2026 17:26:19 - 23/2/2026 17:27:28)**
    *   Removed a `setInterval` that was refreshing local favorites every 3 seconds from the `useEffect` hook, streamlining the favorite status update mechanism to rely solely on `isFavorite` state changes or `item` prop changes.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx` (23/2/2026 19:07:16)**
    *   Updated the `useMemo` for `imgData` to use `generateImageDataFromLiveChannelInHome_v2`.
    *   Improved the `channelLogo` logic to fall back to `item.stream` if `item.channel` is not available.
    *   Modified the `title` rendering to concatenate `item.h1` and `item.presenter` for audio type items.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx` (Frequent Changes: 24/2/2026 10:52:48 - 24/2/2026 14:18:59)**
    *   **Navigation Logic Refinements (24/2/2026 10:52:48, 24/2/2026 10:56:20):** Improved the `handleRowNavigation` logic, especially for wrapping around rows (going down from the last row jumps to the first, and vice-versa) and adjusting the `accumulatedTop` based on whether the visible window moves up or down. This aims to maintain smooth scrolling and focus within the virtualized list.
    *   **Reverted `syncVirtualizationWithData` (24/2/2026 14:18:41, 24/2/2026 14:18:59):** The `syncVirtualizationWithData` function was temporarily introduced and then removed from the return of the hook, suggesting an attempt to centralize virtualization state synchronization that was later discarded or integrated differently.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (24/2/2026 20:47:55)**
    *   Minor refactoring in `generateShowAllElements` with `useEffect` for focus actions.
    *   Updated `onFocusAction` logic for `LandscapeItem` to pass `null` for `teasers` and `dismissFadeIn: true`.
    *   Changed the default `live_refresh_interval` from `3000` to `1000`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

1.  **Live Data Refresh Logic:** The `Page` component (`index.jsx`) frequently deals with fetching and refreshing "Now Playing" live data. There's a recurring pattern of setting up an `setInterval` for `refreshLives` and using `hasRefreshed` ref to manage initial loads versus subsequent refreshes. The `live_refresh_interval` itself is a point of frequent modification, suggesting ongoing tuning of how often live data is updated.
2.  **Virtualization Management:** The `useVirtualizedRows` hook and its integration into `Page` show a strong focus on optimizing performance for lists of rows. Repeated changes to `setVisibleRows`, `setAccumulatedTranslate`, `setAccumulatedTop`, and `setCurrentRow`, along with `resetVirtualization` and `removeVirtualizationState`, indicate continuous work on ensuring smooth scrolling and efficient rendering for dynamic lists, especially when the underlying data (`pageData.children`) changes. The `checkTimeFrame` function in `Page` also frequently interacts with how `setPageData` is called to manage these virtualized rows.
3.  **Platform-Specific Adaptations:** Files like `index.html`, `src\App.jsx`, `src\platform\tizen\tizen.js`, and `src\platform\generic.js` show an explicit concern for platform compatibility (HbbTV, Tizen, WebOS, generic Smart TV). This includes:
    *   Specific Shaka Player versions.
    *   Conditional rendering or logic based on `window.AppGlobal.platform`.
    *   Extensive keyboard event handling (`onKeyDownHandler`) with distinct keycode mappings for WebOS and Tizen.
    *   Tizen-specific API calls for device info, network state, app launching, and screensaver control.
4.  **Debugging and Testing:** Numerous `console.log` statements (e.g., in `tizen.js`, `playerLoader.jsx`, `generic.js`, `btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx`) and temporary code blocks (like the `setInterval` in `Page` to remove items dynamically) suggest active debugging and testing during development. The frequent changes and reverts in `Page`'s `checkTimeFrame` function demonstrate iterative testing of rendering and data update strategies.
5.  **Focus Management:** The use of `useFixedFocus` and custom events like `customNavigation`, along with `registerFocusAction` and `unregisterFocusAction` in components like `LiveItemHome` and `GenericRow`, highlight a robust focus management system tailored for Smart TV navigation. The `nav.fixedFocus.isNavigating` flag is consistently used to control navigation behavior during fixed focus.
6.  **Dependency Updates:** The update of Shaka Player in `index.html` and the use of React Router v7 future flags in `App.jsx` indicate that the project is keeping its dependencies relatively up-to-date or preparing for future upgrades.

## 9:19:38
The provided log details significant development activity within the `3cat_smarttv` project, primarily focusing on the `src\views\page\index.jsx` file, which appears to be a core component for displaying page content, likely a home or category page. There are also updates to `index.html`, `src\App.jsx`, `src\platform\tizen\tizen.js`, `src\player\playerLoader.jsx`, `src\platform\generic.js`, `src\fonts.scss`, `src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx`, `src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx`, `src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx`, and `src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx`.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (20/2/2026 12:11:57 - 24/2/2026 20:50:12)**:
    *   This file underwent numerous changes across multiple timestamps, indicating active development on the main page component.
    *   **Initial Change (20/2/2026, 12:11:57):** The `live_refresh_interval` variable was hardcoded to `3000` (commented out `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`).
    *   **Subsequent Change (20/2/2026, 12:12:08):** The `live_refresh_interval` was changed back to `10000` (commented out `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`), effectively restoring the default/fallback value.
    *   **Later changes (starting 23/2/2026):**
        *   The `live_refresh_interval` was reverted to dynamically use `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`.
        *   Extensive modifications were made within the `checkTimeFrame` helper function and the `setPageData` calls.
        *   There was a period (23/2/2026 17:31:09 to 23/2/2026 23:31:18) where `setPageData` was commented out and `homeDataRef.current` was directly mutated before `setPageData` was uncommented and then briefly wrapped in a `setInterval` with a 2-second delay (23/2/2026 23:33:59). This suggests attempts to optimize or control rendering updates for live data.
        *   The `live_refresh_interval` was again briefly hardcoded to `2000` (23/2/2026 23:39:38).
        *   A more complex logic was introduced in `checkTimeFrame` (23/2/2026 19:09:03) to handle full re-renders only on the first load (`!hasRefreshed.current`) and then selectively update only "live rows" in subsequent refreshes using `setPageData(prev => ...)` to avoid unnecessary re-renders. This logic was then largely reverted or simplified in later changes, suggesting challenges with this optimization.
        *   A `setTimeout` was introduced (24/2/2026 13:07:23 onwards) in `checkTimeFrame` to filter out an item at index 3 from `pageData.children` after a delay (initially 10 seconds, then 20 seconds, then 1ms, then removed). This likely indicates debugging or testing a dynamic removal of content.
        *   A new `useEffect` hook was added (24/2/2026 13:40:08) to simulate live data updates and an item removal (specifically `splice(3, 1)` to remove the 4th item) every 10 seconds, using `fakeEntries`. This was probably a temporary testing mechanism.
        *   Changes related to `resetVirtualization()` and `removeVirtualizationState()` were introduced within `setPageData`'s update logic when `rowsChanged` (24/2/2026 14:15:20 to 14:39:42), indicating an attempt to re-initialize virtualization state upon significant data structure changes.
        *   The `live_refresh_interval` was temporarily set to `6000000` (very long) in some commits (e.g., 24/2/2026 13:07:41), likely to pause or control live refresh during debugging.
        *   The debugging `useEffect` simulating removal was commented out (24/2/2026 14:41:54).
        *   The logic for re-initializing virtualization state on `rowsChanged` within `setPageData` was frequently added and removed or modified, suggesting issues with its implementation or desired behavior. By 24/2/2026 20:50:12, it looks like this explicit `resetVirtualization` and `navigate` logic was removed from `checkTimeFrame`.

2.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html` (20/2/2026 12:16:22)**:
    *   Updated the `shaka.js` player library from `shaka-4-7-1.js` to `shaka.4.13.8.js`.
    *   Added `ima3.js` for Google IMA SDK.
    *   The `title` meta tag was changed from "3Cat" to "3Cat, la plataforma digital de continguts en català i de qualitat".

3.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (20/2/2026 12:16:57)**:
    *   Added a new context provider `ParentalControlProvider` and wrapped `VirtualizationProvider` within it.
    *   Updated `BrowserRouter` with new `future` props (`v7_startTransition: true, v7_relativeSplatPath: true`).
    *   Introduced `VideoSpinner` component.

4.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (20/2/2026 13:13:26)**:
    *   Improved logging for Tizen device information and added debug calls (`debugTizenAppCommon`).
    *   Enhanced `visibilitychange` event handling to pause/stop `webapis.avplay` when hidden and play when resumed.
    *   Added `webapis.avplay.stop()` to the `visibilitychange` handler's hidden branch.
    *   Updated the `openSamsungStore` function to include `caller_id` in `ApplicationControlData`.

5.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerLoader.jsx` (20/2/2026 18:52:39)**:
    *   Modified the handling of `vmapUrl` for advertisements, moving from stripping query parameters to using a new `build3catVmapUrl` function for macro replacement with real values. This indicates a more sophisticated ad integration.
    *   Added `window.BufferingIndicator.show()` and `hide()` calls within `useEffect` for better buffering indication.
    *   Added screen saver disable/enable calls around player lifecycle.
    *   Added calls to `removeSubtitlesStyles()` on component cleanup.

6.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (20/2/2026 18:58:23 - 20/2/2026 19:25:16)**:
    *   The `onKeyDownHandler` function saw repeated changes regarding `e.stopPropagation()`:
        *   Initially commented out (18:58:23).
        *   Then uncommented (`e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation();`) (19:05:58).
        *   `e.stopPropagation()` was commented out again, leaving only `e.preventDefault();` (19:15:17).
        *   `e.stopPropagation()` was moved to the end of the `onKeyDownHandler` function (19:21:43).
        *   Finally, `e.stopPropagation()` was removed completely from the end of the `onKeyDownHandler` (19:25:16). This suggests careful fine-tuning of event propagation behavior.

7.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss` (23/2/2026 12:40:42)**:
    *   Added several `@font-face` rules for "Roboto" font with various weights (Black, Bold, Light, Medium, Regular, Thin), indicating an expansion of font usage in the application.

8.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx` (23/2/2026 17:26:19 - 23/2/2026 17:27:28)**:
    *   An `setInterval` to refresh local favorites every 3 seconds was removed (23/2/2026 17:27:28). The `refresh_LOCAL_FavoritesList` is now called only on initial component mount and when `item` changes.

9.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx` (23/2/2026 19:07:16)**:
    *   Improved image data generation (`generateImageDataFromLiveChannelInHome_v2`).
    *   Updated `channelLogo` logic to also check `item.stream` for images.
    *   Enhanced `onFocusAction` callback in `useEffect` to trigger only if `origin !== 'mouse'`.
    *   Added `data-group-restore-last-focused='true'` attribute.
    *   Introduced `platform-footer` for external content with platform logo and an external link icon.
    *   Added logic to display "LIVE" or "UPCOMING" tags for external content.
    *   Modified the display of `item.h1` and `item.h2` for audio content to include presenter information.

10. **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx` (24/2/2026 10:52:48 - 24/2/2026 14:18:59)**:
    *   Significant refactoring of the row virtualization logic.
    *   **10:52:48:** Simplified `handleRowNavigation` logic for `newVisibleRows` calculation and moved `setCurrentRow` and `setVisibleRows` updates to the end of the function.
    *   **10:56:20:** Introduced a wrap-around behavior for "down" navigation (if at last row, jump to first). Added logic to adjust `accumulatedTop` only if the visible window `start` changes.
    *   **14:14:06 - 14:18:59:** The `syncVirtualizationWithData` function was temporarily imported and then removed, suggesting an attempt to handle virtualization state more intelligently when the underlying data changes, which was then reverted or absorbed into `resetVirtualization`.

11. **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (24/2/2026 20:47:55)**:
    *   Updated the `onFocusAction` logic for `LandscapeProgressBarItem` and `Inline` (PrescriptorItem) row types, conditionally setting `item.teasers` to `null` and `dismissFadeIn` to `true`. This suggests fine-tuning of focus behavior for these specific row types.
    *   Minor adjustments to props passed to `RowElement`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Focus Management and Navigation:** Numerous changes across `index.jsx` (page view), `generic.js` (platform keyboard handling), and `useVirtualizedRows.jsx` (custom hook) indicate a strong focus on refining the navigation and focus behavior, especially in a Smart TV context. This includes handling fixed focus, virtualized rows, and custom navigation events (`customNavigation`).
*   **Live Content Handling:** The `checkTimeFrame` and `refreshLives` functions in `src\views\page\index.jsx` are frequently updated, showing ongoing efforts to accurately display and refresh live stream data, merge API responses, and handle time-based content filtering. The `live_refresh_interval` variable's frequent changes and hardcoding also point to testing and tuning this live data refresh mechanism.
*   **Virtualization and Performance:** The `useVirtualizedRows` hook and its integration into `src\views\page\index.jsx` highlight a strategy to optimize rendering performance by only showing a subset of rows (virtualization). The repeated attempts to modify `setPageData` logic in `checkTimeFrame` and the introduction/removal of `syncVirtualizationWithData` further emphasize this focus on performance and efficient state updates, especially when the underlying data structure changes.
*   **Debugging and Testing:** Several changes, such as the temporary `setTimeout` for removing an item from `pageData.children` and the `useEffect` to simulate `fakeEntries` and item removal in `src\views\page\index.jsx`, suggest active debugging and testing of dynamic content changes and their impact on rendering and virtualization. The console logs (`ajsrConsole.log`, `console.log`) also serve debugging purposes.
*   **Platform Specific Adjustments:** Changes in `tizen.js` and `generic.js` show adaptations for specific Smart TV platforms (Tizen, WebOS, Hisense, HbbTV) regarding keyboard input handling, screen saver management, and application lifecycle events (`visibilitychange`).
*   **UI/UX Refinements:** Updates to `index.html` for player libraries and titles, addition of "Roboto" font, and `LiveItemHome` component enhancements (external content tags, logos, presenter info) indicate continuous improvement of the user interface and experience.
*   **Refactoring and State Management:** The evolution of how `pageData` is updated within `checkTimeFrame` (direct mutation of `homeDataRef.current` vs. creating `newData` objects and `setPageData(prev => ...)`) shows a progression towards more idiomatic React state management patterns, aiming for immutability and controlled re-renders.

## 10:19:41
The log details several changes across three files in the `3cat_smarttv` project, focusing primarily on `index.jsx` within the `src\views\page` directory, `index.html`, `App.jsx`, `tizen.js`, `playerLoader.jsx`, `generic.js`, `btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx`, `liveItemHome\index.jsx`, and `genericRow\index.jsx`.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx`** (20/2/2026, 12:11:57 - 24/2/2026, 14:44:26):
    *   **Live Refresh Interval:** Initially, `live_refresh_interval` was hardcoded to `3000` (then `10000`) and later reverted to using `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`. There were several intermediate changes where `live_refresh_interval` was explicitly set to `1000`, `2000`, and `6000000` (which is very long) before being restored to `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`.
    *   **Data Filtering and State Management:** Significant modifications were made to the `checkTimeFrame` function, which is responsible for updating live data and the `pageData` state.
        *   **Initial `checkTimeFrame` Logic:** Directly set `setPageData` with filtered children after updating `homeDataRef.current`.
        *   **Intermediate Changes (23/2/2026, 19:09:03):** Introduced more explicit state management for `setPageData` to handle initial renders (`!hasRefreshed.current`) vs. subsequent updates (only updating live rows if `livePositionsToUpdate` has entries). It aimed to prevent unnecessary full re-renders by creating new references only for changed live rows.
        *   **Further Refinements (23/2/2026, 23:31:18 - 24/2/2026, 0:10:46):** The logic within `checkTimeFrame` for updating `pageData` was frequently altered, with comments indicating attempts to debounce or control re-renders (e.g., introducing a `setInterval` to update `pageData` every 2 seconds, then removing it).
        *   **Simulated Row Removal (24/2/2026, 12:57:22 - 24/2/2026, 13:40:08):** A new `useEffect` hook was added to `Page` component to simulate dynamic row removal. This hook was set up to `splice(3, 1)` from `homeDataRef.current.children` every 10 seconds, effectively removing the 4th row (index 3). This was likely for testing dynamic content changes and virtualization. This logic was later commented out (24/2/2026, 14:36:17) or removed entirely, indicating it was a temporary test.
        *   **Virtualization Reset on Row Count Change (24/2/2026, 13:34:57 - 24/2/2026, 14:44:26):** The `checkTimeFrame` function was updated to detect changes in the number of children (`rowsChanged`). If the row count changes, it triggers `resetVirtualization()` and `removeVirtualizationState(location.pathname)` from `useVirtualizedRows` and navigates to the current path with `replace: true`, effectively forcing a full reset of the page's virtualization state and a re-render. This implies a focus on handling dynamic content changes that affect the number of rows.
        *   **`filterChildren` behavior:** A change was introduced to filter the 4th item (`index !== 3`) from the `children` array in some specific branches, likely for testing purposes.
    *   **`useEffect` Hooks:** The component's `useEffect` hooks also saw minor tweaks in initial states and cleanup.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html`** (20/2/2026, 12:16:22):
    *   **Player Library Updates:** The Shaka Player library was updated from `shaka-4-7-1.js` to `shaka.4.13.8.js`.
    *   **IMA SDK:** Google IMA SDK script (`ima3.js`) was added.
    *   **Debug Console:** Scripts for `purple-console.min.js` and custom `window.debug` functions (`ajsrConsole`) were present for logging.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx`** (20/2/2026, 12:16:57):
    *   **VirtualizationProvider:** The `VirtualizationProvider` context was introduced to wrap the `BrowserRouter`, indicating a new system for managing row virtualization state across the application.
    *   **Debug Information Display:** Added more conditions (`window.appConfig.test_app.show...`) to conditionally render build, user agent, version, platform, and player debug information.
    *   **Event Handling:** `window.AppGlobal.Actions.openCloseSessionModal` and `openExitAppModal` were linked to specific modal types for logout and exit functionalities.
    *   **User Logout Flow:** Modified the logout flow for kid users to dispatch `evChangeUser` and navigate to `/usersScreen` or `/home`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js`** (20/2/2026, 13:13:26):
    *   **Screen Saver Management:** Extensive logging and implementation for enabling/disabling the Tizen screen saver (`webapis.appcommon.setScreenSaver`) were added, and `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.status` is updated.
    *   **Player Actions on Visibility Change:** Added logic to pause the player when the app is hidden and play when resumed.
    *   **Network State Listener:** Implemented a listener for Tizen network state changes (`webapis.network.addNetworkStateChangeListener`) to dispatch `evNetworkDisconnected` and `evNetworkConnected` events.
    *   **Key Registration:** Registered additional Samsung TV remote keys (MediaPlay, MediaPause, etc., and numeric keys) for enhanced control.
    *   **App Launching and Store Integration:** Functions (`launchAppTizen`, `openSamsungStore`) for launching other Tizen applications and opening the Samsung App Store were introduced.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerLoader.jsx`** (20/2/2026, 18:52:39):
    *   **Subtitle Styles:** Added functions `setSubtitlesStyles` and `removeSubtitlesStyles` to dynamically apply CSS classes to the `cueContainer` based on user preferences (font size, background color, position).
    *   **Ad Tag URL Generation:** Updated logic for `vmapUrl` to use `build3catVmapUrl` and `getVmapParamsPlatform` for dynamically building ad tag URLs with platform-specific and GDPR parameters, replacing a previous approach that stripped query parameters.
    *   **Screen Saver Integration:** Added `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.disable()` on component mount and `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.enable()` on cleanup.
    *   **Buffering Indicator:** Integrated `window.BufferingIndicator.show()` and `hide()` calls to manage a buffering UI.
    *   **Autoplay/Time Marker Logic:** Refined the logic for `creditsMarkerIndex` to handle `autoplay` and `relatedData` availability, and to insert a default `credits` time marker if `autoplay` is enabled and `auto_next_episode_seconds` is configured.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js`** (20/2/2026, 18:58:23 - 20/2/2026, 19:25:16):
    *   **Keyboard Event Handling:** Changes focused on `onKeyDownHandler` to prevent default actions (`e.preventDefault()`, `e.stopPropagation()`) for certain key events. The `e.stopPropagation()` was initially present, then removed, then re-added for all keys, and finally removed from the general handler, only being present at the end of the `onKeyDownHandler` function, allowing some events to propagate initially.
    *   **Player Key Filtering:** Added a check `if (PLAYER_KEYS.has(keyCode) && (!window.AppGlobal.Player || !window.AppGlobal.Player.isReady))` to ignore player-related key presses if the player is not ready.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx`** (23/2/2026, 17:26:19 - 23/2/2026, 17:27:28):
    *   **Removed Interval:** An `setInterval` that called `refresh_LOCAL_FavoritesList()` every 3 seconds was removed from the initial `useEffect` hook. The `refresh_LOCAL_FavoritesList()` call now only occurs once on mount.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx`** (23/2/2026, 19:07:16):
    *   **Image Generation:** Updated `generateImageDataFromLiveChannelInHome_v2` to be used for image data.
    *   **External Content Display:** Enhanced handling of external content, including `platformLogo` and `icLinkExterior` icon, along with `isLiveExternal` and `whiteTagText` from `useExternalEmission` hook.
    *   **Focus Management:** Added `registerFocusAction` and `unregisterFocusAction` to manage focus for individual live items.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss`** (23/2/2026, 12:40:42):
    *   **Font Definitions:** This file solely defines `@font-face` rules for "Bw 3Cat" and "Roboto" fonts, including various weights and styles, using both `.ttf` and `.woff` formats. It also sets the `body` font to "Bw 3Cat".

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx`** (24/2/2026, 10:52:48 - 24/2/2026, 14:18:59):
    *   **`handleRowNavigation` Logic:** The `handleRowNavigation` function was modified to properly handle wrapping from the last row to the first when navigating "down". The logic for calculating `newVisibleRows` and adjusting `accumulatedTop` based on window changes was refined.
    *   **Virtualization State Management:** The `saveVirtualization` and `removeVirtualizationState` functions ensure that the state of visible rows, scroll positions, and focused element IDs is stored and retrieved per page, preventing loss of context upon navigation.
    *   **`syncVirtualizationWithData` removal:** The `syncVirtualizationWithData` function was added as a prop in `page/index.jsx` but was not implemented or exported from `useVirtualizedRows.jsx` (24/2/2026, 14:15:20), indicating a potential half-implemented feature or a change in approach. Later it was removed as a prop from the `Page` component.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx`** (24/2/2026, 20:47:55):
    *   **Row Element Mapping:** Added `LIVE_TV` to map to `LiveItemHome` in `getRowElement` for live content.
    *   **Show All Elements Focus Shape:** Updated `getShowAllElementsFocusShape` to include 'keyframe' for `LIVE_TV` and `LAST_DAYS`.
    *   **`onFocusAction` Handling:** Modified `onFocusAction` logic within the mapped `RowElement` to prevent `teasers` from being passed when not needed and to handle `null` for `FEATURED` and `INLINE` row types.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Focus Management:** There's a strong emphasis on consistent focus management across various components (`Page`, `LiveItemHome`, `GenericRow`) using a global `nav` object (`nav.focusById`, `nav.move.up/down/left/right`, `nav.action`, `nav.fixedFocus.isNavigating`) and event listeners for custom navigation (`customNavigation`). This suggests a UI designed for remote control interaction on smart TVs.
*   **Virtualization:** The introduction and refinement of `useVirtualizedRows` and `VirtualizationContext` indicate an effort to optimize performance for pages with many rows of content by rendering only visible elements and preserving scroll state across navigations.
*   **Live Content Handling:** The `Page` component frequently updates `live_refresh_interval` and implements intricate logic within `checkTimeFrame`, `mergeData`, `getNowPlayingSelectorData`, and `refreshLives` to dynamically fetch and update "Now Playing" and live stream data. This involves merging API data, filtering based on timeframes, and updating the UI with minimal re-renders.
*   **Platform-Specific Logic:** The codebase includes explicit checks for `window.AppGlobal.platform` (e.g., `'hbbtv'`, `'webos'`, `'tizen'`) to apply platform-specific behaviors, such as filtering content or handling key events.
*   **Context API Usage:** Heavy reliance on React Contexts (`AuthContext`, `OptionsContext`, `SettingsContext`, `SitecatalystContext`, `CapabilitiesContext`, `VirtualizationContext`, `HighlightContext`, `BroadcastContext`, `HistoryContext`, `DidomiContext`, `ParentalControlContext`, `TextsContext`) suggests a robust state management architecture.
*   **Error Handling and Authentication:** API calls often include error callbacks that handle "Unauthorized" or "Token expired" messages by redirecting to authentication screens or logging out the user.
*   **Debugging and Logging:** Extensive `ajsrConsole.log` and `console.log` statements are present across many files, along with debug panels and functions in `App.jsx` and `tizen.js`, indicating an active development and debugging phase.
*   **Font Inclusion:** A dedicated `fonts.scss` file is used to define custom fonts (`Bw 3Cat` and `Roboto`) with various weights and formats, ensuring consistent typography.
*   **Dynamic UI Updates:** The `Page` component's `checkTimeFrame` function, and its numerous iterations, show a pattern of attempting to update the UI efficiently for live data changes, initially by full state updates and later by more granular updates to avoid unnecessary re-renders. The introduction and removal of `splice(3,1)` for rows indicates testing of content that might disappear or appear dynamically, further pushing the need for robust virtualization logic.
*   **Styling:** SCSS files (`styles.scss`, `styles.kids.scss`, `playerLoader.scss`, `stylesLive.scss`, `stylesVod.scss`, `cueContainer.scss`, `index.scss`, `row.scss`) are consistently used for component styling, often with separate files for "kids" profiles.
