# Activity Summary for 28/2/2026

## 4:17:49
The provided log details changes across several files, primarily focusing on updates to the `src\views\page\index.jsx` component, `src\platform\generic.js` for keyboard navigation, and `src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx` for UI virtualization, with minor adjustments in `index.html`, `src\App.jsx`, `src\platform\tizen\tizen.js`, `src\player\playerLoader.jsx`, `src\fonts.scss`, `src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx`, and `src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx`.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (Frequent Changes: 20/2/2026 12:11:57 - 24/2/2026 14:44:26, 25/2/2026 11:20:38 - 25/2/2026 11:23:07)**
    *   **Initial Changes (20/2/2026 12:11:57 - 12:12:08):** A minor change in the `live_refresh_interval` from `3000` to `10000` was made, and then reverted to `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`. This indicates testing or adjustments to the live data refresh rate.
    *   **Refactoring `checkTimeFrame` and `setPageData` (23/2/2026 19:09:03):** The `checkTimeFrame` function was significantly refactored. It now uses a `Set` to track `livePositionsToUpdate`, and the `setPageData` logic was updated to differentiate between initial page load (`!hasRefreshed.current`) and subsequent live row updates, aiming for more efficient re-renders by only updating changed rows on subsequent refreshes. This change was then reverted and re-implemented in different ways.
    *   **Debugging `checkTimeFrame` (23/2/2026 23:31:18):** A `console.log(homeDataRef.current)` was added inside `checkTimeFrame`, suggesting debugging efforts.
    *   **Interval for `setPageData` (23/2/2026 23:33:59):** An `setInterval` was briefly introduced in `checkTimeFrame` to update `pageData` every 2 seconds, which was later removed. This likely points to attempts to control the rendering frequency for live data.
    *   **`live_refresh_interval` Adjustments (23/2/2026 23:39:38, 23/2/2026 23:58:29, 24/2/2026 0:00:35, 24/2/2026 0:00:58, 24/2/2026 0:01:26):** The `live_refresh_interval` was repeatedly toggled between a hardcoded `1000` or `2000` and the `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000` value, indicating experimentation with live refresh rates.
    *   **`setPageData` and `filterChildren` Logic Modifications (24/2/2026 0:04:01, 24/2/2026 0:06:46, 24/2/2026 0:08:59, 24/2/2026 12:55:28, 24/2/2026 12:56:38, 24/2/2026 12:57:22, 24/2/2026 13:00:39, 24/2/2026 13:03:18):** There were several iterations of logic within `checkTimeFrame` related to how `setPageData` is called and how `newChildren` (derived from `filterChildren`) is compared to `prev.children` to prevent unnecessary re-renders. A specific line `c = c.filter((_, index) => index !== 3);` was added and removed multiple times within `checkTimeFrame`, suggesting dynamic removal of a specific row (index 3), likely for testing purposes.
    *   **`live_refresh_interval` Increased and Interval for Row Removal (24/2/2026 13:10:49, 24/2/2026 13:10:59):** The `live_refresh_interval` was significantly increased to `6000000` (likely disabling the interval for debugging) while a `setTimeout` was introduced to dynamically remove a row (index 3) after 20 seconds. This indicates testing of dynamic row removal. This `setTimeout` was then removed.
    *   **Re-introduction of Row Removal Logic within `checkTimeFrame` (24/2/2026 13:43:58, 24/2/2026 13:45:08):** The `newChildren.splice(3, 1)` logic was re-added within `checkTimeFrame` conditional on `hasRefreshed.current`, implying a mechanism to remove a specific row after the initial load.
    *   **Virtualization Reset on Row Count Change (24/2/2026 13:46:15, 24/2/2026 14:17:47):** Logic was added to `setPageData` in `checkTimeFrame` to call `resetVirtualization()` and `removeVirtualizationState(location.pathname)` if `rowsChanged` is true, followed by navigating back to the current path. This ensures the virtualization state is correctly reset when the number of rows changes.
    *   **Reverted interval in `useEffect` (24/2/2026 13:40:08):** A `useEffect` block containing a `setInterval` that simulated changes and removed a row was added, then later removed. This was another attempt to test dynamic content changes and virtualization.
    *   **Final `setPageData` Update Logic (24/2/2026 14:39:42 - 24/2/2026 14:44:26, 25/2/2026 11:20:38 - 25/2/2026 11:23:07):** The conditional check for `prev && prev.children.length != newChildren.length` was consistently applied to trigger a full reset of virtualization and navigation when the number of rows changes, which is a key pattern for handling dynamic content in a virtualized list.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html` (20/2/2026 12:16:22)**
    *   Updated the Shaka Player version from `shaka-4-7-1.js` to `shaka.4.13.8.js`, indicating a player dependency upgrade.
    *   Cleaned up commented-out script tags for Shaka Player and vtt.js.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (20/2/2026 12:16:57)**
    *   Added `VideoSpinner` component import and usage, suggesting the addition of a loading indicator for video playback.
    *   Included a `BroadcastProvider` for HbbTV platforms, indicating platform-specific context management.
    *   Updated `BrowserRouter` with `future={{v7_startTransition: true, v7_relativeSplatPath: true}}`, preparing for future React Router v7 features.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (20/2/2026 13:13:26)**
    *   Added console logging for Tizen device information and visibility change events.
    *   Implemented `evExitApplication` event listener to gracefully exit the Tizen application.
    *   Introduced `initNetworkStateListener` to dispatch `evNetworkDisconnected` and `evNetworkConnected` events, improving network state handling.
    *   Enhanced `initExtraSamsungKeys` to register a wider range of Samsung TV remote keys, including numeric, media control, and color buttons.
    *   Added `launchAppTizen` and `openSamsungStore` functions, allowing the application to launch other Tizen apps or open the Samsung app store.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerLoader.jsx` (20/2/2026 18:52:39)**
    *   Improved ad URL handling by replacing a simple query strip with a `build3catVmapUrl` function for more robust macro replacement in VMAP URLs.
    *   Added `window.BufferingIndicator.show()` and `hide()` calls to manage a global buffering indicator.
    *   Implemented `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.disable()` and `enable()` for controlling screen saver behavior during playback.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (Frequent Changes: 20/2/2026 18:58:23 - 20/2/2026 19:25:16)**
    *   Modified keyboard event handling. Specifically, `e.preventDefault()` was commented out and then re-enabled, and `e.stopPropagation()` was commented out, re-enabled, and then moved to the end of the `onKeyDownHandler` function, indicating fine-tuning of event propagation control for keyboard inputs across different Smart TV platforms.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss` (23/2/2026 12:40:42)**
    *   Added new `@font-face` definitions for "Bw 3Cat" and "Roboto" fonts, including different weights and styles, and specified both TTF and WOFF formats for "Bw 3Cat." The `body` element was updated to use "Bw 3Cat" as the primary font.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx` (23/2/2026 17:26:19 - 23/2/2026 17:27:28)**
    *   Removed a `setInterval` that was refreshing local favorites every 3 seconds from the `useEffect` hook, streamlining the favorite status update mechanism to rely solely on `isFavorite` state changes or `item` prop changes.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx` (23/2/2026 19:07:16)**
    *   Updated the `useMemo` for `imgData` to use `generateImageDataFromLiveChannelInHome_v2`.
    *   Improved the `channelLogo` logic to fall back to `item.stream` if `item.channel` is not available.
    *   Modified the `title` rendering to concatenate `item.h1` and `item.presenter` for audio type items.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx` (Frequent Changes: 24/2/2026 10:52:48 - 24/2/2026 14:18:59)**
    *   **Navigation Logic Refinements (24/2/2026 10:52:48, 24/2/2026 10:56:20):** Improved the `handleRowNavigation` logic, especially for wrapping around rows (going down from the last row jumps to the first, and vice-versa) and adjusting the `accumulatedTop` based on whether the visible window moves up or down. This aims to maintain smooth scrolling and focus within the virtualized list.
    *   **Reverted `syncVirtualizationWithData` (24/2/2026 14:18:41, 24/2/2026 14:18:59):** The `syncVirtualizationWithData` function was temporarily introduced and then removed from the return of the hook, suggesting an attempt to centralize virtualization state synchronization that was later discarded or integrated differently.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (24/2/2026 20:47:55)**
    *   Minor refactoring in `generateShowAllElements` with `useEffect` for focus actions.
    *   Updated `onFocusAction` logic for `LandscapeItem` to pass `null` for `teasers` and `dismissFadeIn: true`.
    *   Changed the default `live_refresh_interval` from `3000` to `1000`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

1.  **Live Data Refresh Logic:** The `Page` component (`index.jsx`) frequently deals with fetching and refreshing "Now Playing" live data. There's a recurring pattern of setting up an `setInterval` for `refreshLives` and using `hasRefreshed` ref to manage initial loads versus subsequent refreshes. The `live_refresh_interval` itself is a point of frequent modification, suggesting ongoing tuning of how often live data is updated.
2.  **Virtualization Management:** The `useVirtualizedRows` hook and its integration into `Page` show a strong focus on optimizing performance for lists of rows. Repeated changes to `setVisibleRows`, `setAccumulatedTranslate`, `setAccumulatedTop`, and `setCurrentRow`, along with `resetVirtualization` and `removeVirtualizationState`, indicate continuous work on ensuring smooth scrolling and efficient rendering for dynamic lists, especially when the underlying data (`pageData.children`) changes. The `checkTimeFrame` function in `Page` also frequently interacts with how `setPageData` is called to manage these virtualized rows.
3.  **Platform-Specific Adaptations:** Files like `index.html`, `src\App.jsx`, `src\platform\tizen\tizen.js`, and `src\platform\generic.js` show an explicit concern for platform compatibility (HbbTV, Tizen, WebOS, generic Smart TV). This includes:
    *   Specific Shaka Player versions.
    *   Conditional rendering or logic based on `window.AppGlobal.platform`.
    *   Extensive keyboard event handling (`onKeyDownHandler`) with distinct keycode mappings for WebOS and Tizen.
    *   Tizen-specific API calls for device info, network state, app launching, and screensaver control.
4.  **Debugging and Testing:** Numerous `console.log` statements (e.g., in `tizen.js`, `playerLoader.jsx`, `generic.js`, `btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx`) and temporary code blocks (like the `setInterval` in `Page` to remove items dynamically) suggest active debugging and testing during development. The frequent changes and reverts in `Page`'s `checkTimeFrame` function demonstrate iterative testing of rendering and data update strategies.
5.  **Focus Management:** The use of `useFixedFocus` and custom events like `customNavigation`, along with `registerFocusAction` and `unregisterFocusAction` in components like `LiveItemHome` and `GenericRow`, highlight a robust focus management system tailored for Smart TV navigation. The `nav.fixedFocus.isNavigating` flag is consistently used to control navigation behavior during fixed focus.
6.  **Dependency Updates:** The update of Shaka Player in `index.html` and the use of React Router v7 future flags in `App.jsx` indicate that the project is keeping its dependencies relatively up-to-date or preparing for future upgrades.
