# Activity Summary for 8/2/2026

## 3:20:42
The code changes primarily focus on a SmartTV application, with significant updates across UI components, styling, platform-specific integrations, and overall application flow.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\3cat_pro\gateway\js\app.js` (2/2/2026, 14:16:27):** The gateway application logic was updated to dynamically set the `REMOTE` content URL and `connectionmanager` service endpoint based on the WebOS `sdkVersion`. Specifically, SDK versions less than 300 use `PALM_MANAGER`, and versions less than 350 direct to `'https://smartv-pro.3cat.website/'`. It also includes robust network status checking, displaying an alert if no internet is available and redirecting to the remote URL upon successful connection. A keydown listener for the back button (`VK_BACK`) was added for WebOS platform navigation.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx` (2/2/2026, 16:31:34):** This media information component underwent substantial changes to handle diverse content types. New `EpisodeCount` and `SeasonsCount` components were introduced. A `Publication` feature was commented out (JIRA CCMA-2104). The `showExpiration` function was added to display content availability end dates, considering a three-month lookahead. Logic for determining `logoImage`, `channelLogo`, `duration`, `title`, and `description` was enhanced to prioritize `default_episode` and accommodate live streams, audio, and linked content. Conditional rendering for program and episode titles was refined, and support for external content (displaying platform logos and tags) was integrated.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\mediaTitle\styles.scss` (2/2/2026, 16:33:36):** Minor styling adjustments were made to `mediaTitle` subclasses, modifying `font-weight` and `font-size` for `.title_program`, `.live`, `.stream`, `.isLive_or_upcoming_event`, and `.menu_detail` (which received a bolder weight), and `.external`.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\portraitItem\styles.scss` (2/2/2026, 16:39:57):** Styles were added to incorporate `.platform-logo`, `.externalLogo`, and `.externalIcon` within portrait items, indicating visual support for external content platforms. Focus and hover styles were also refined for better user feedback.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\keyboard\styles.scss` (2/2/2026, 16:56:08 & 17:09:25):** New SCSS was added to define the visual appearance of an on-screen keyboard, including general key styles, size variations (SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE), and icon-based keys (BACKSPACE, SPACE_BAR, RETURN). A `:hover` state was also added to keys, mirroring the focused appearance.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (2/2/2026, 17:08:44) & `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (5/2/2026, 13:32:40):** This file received substantial updates to its keyboard navigation. A `KeyMemory` object was introduced to track key combinations for specific actions like enabling/disabling player ads. The `onKeyDownHandler` was expanded with a throttle (`THROTTLE_MS`) to prevent rapid input processing, and now explicitly prevents default event behavior. Platform-specific key codes for WebOS and Tizen (Play, Pause, Stop, Rewind, FastForward) were integrated, although the specific `dispatchRewindEvent()` and `dispatchFastForwardEvent()` calls were later commented out.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\index.jsx` (2/2/2026, 17:36:09 & 17:36:22):** The `SideMenu` component was developed to manage a two-level menu structure, handling state for selected options (`selL1`, `selL2`) and menu visibility. It includes logic to dynamically generate menu data based on user type (e.g., kid profile), attach a "Search" option, and refresh the selected menu item based on the current URL. Functions for opening, closing, and managing focus within the menu were defined. Minor changes involved adding `window.__isEntry = isMenuVisible;` to a `useEffect` hook.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\onboarding\usersScreen\index.jsx` (2/2/2026, 17:45:11 -> 18:14:59):** This component for selecting users iterated through multiple minor changes. It displays logged-in users, a "Super3" kids profile option, and an "Add User" option, with callbacks for selection. The primary area of change involved the `window.__isEntry` and `window.__foceEntry` flags. Initially setting `__isEntry` from `location.state`, it then directly assigned `true`, commented out `location` usage, and finally introduced a `useEffect` to manage `window.__foceEntry` on mount/unmount for controlled entry-point behavior.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\utils\goBackHistory.js` (2/2/2026, 18:15:16):** The `goBackHistory` utility was modified to check for `window.__isEntry` or `window.__foceEntry` flags, allowing it to execute a callback (e.g., open an exit app modal) instead of performing a `history.go(-1)` navigation, aligning with the `usersScreen` changes.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (2/2/2026, 18:50:50 -> 19:14:36):** The main application file received iterative adjustments related to modal and menu interaction. It defines the application's routing structure and context providers. Updates involved repeatedly commenting out and re-enabling lines for showing the exit modal (`setExitModal(ModalTypes.EXIT)`) and managing menu focus (`AppMenu.manageFocused?.()`) within the `openExitAppModal` function, indicating a period of active debugging and fine-tuning of application exit behavior.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\tizen\3cat_pro\config.xml` (3/2/2026, 13:24:24 -> 5/2/2026, 11:41:17):** The Tizen application configuration file had its `id` attributes for both `widget` and `tizen:application` modified. Specifically, `http://tizen.tv3.ccma.cat.qa` became `http://tizen.qa.ccma.cat`, and the application ID was adjusted from `PzkKxRdFT6.TV3.qa` to `PzkKxRdFT6qa.TV3`. This suggests an update to application identifiers, likely for a QA environment.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx` (4/2/2026, 11:36:24 -> 14:01:29):** This component, responsible for rendering round items, underwent extensive refactoring. It initially toggled logic for `isKidsProfile` and specific image formats (like `big-round`), eventually consolidating to use an `isBigRound` prop. This prop now dictates the image format search (`big-round` vs. `round`) and dynamically sets the `data-nav-fixed-focus-shape` attribute to `bigRound` or `round`.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.scss` (4/2/2026, 13:53:09):** New styles were added for `.roundElement` and a new `.biground_row` class, defining specific widths, heights, margins, and borders to visually differentiate between standard and "big round" items.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.kids.scss` (4/2/2026, 12:22:36 -> 14:12:14):** This file saw frequent, small changes to `background-color` and `border` properties for `.roundElement` within `kid-mode`, indicating ongoing design iterations for the kids' UI. The border property was repeatedly added and removed.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.kids.scss` (4/2/2026, 12:26:49 -> 14:14:40):** Numerous adjustments were made to the focus styles for elements in `kid-mode`. This included changes to `box-shadow`, `border-color`, and `outline` for general focused elements, and specific modifications for `.round` and `.bigRound` focus shapes, often involving toggling between different properties or color values.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\index.jsx` (4/2/2026, 12:27:53 -> 13:42:39):** This component, which renders rows of `RoundItem`s, was updated to pass the `isBigRound` prop (replacing previous `isKidsProfile` prop), and conditionally apply the `biground_row` class to its container. It also had `styles.kids.scss` imported and removed multiple times.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\styles.scss` (4/2/2026, 12:28:04 & 13:40:37):** This SCSS file was updated to define separate heights for `.round_row` and the newly introduced `.biground_row`, as well as general styles for `.roundItemTitle`.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\styles.kids.scss` (4/2/2026, 12:30:18):** A commented-out height adjustment for `.round_row` in `kid-mode` was present.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (4/2/2026, 12:02:26 -> 12:54:35):** The `GenericRow` component was extended to handle `SQUARE_MINI` as a distinct row type, mapping it to `SquareItem`. It also gained more refined logic for `generateShowAllElements` and `isExternalRow`. A potentially erroneous line was added for conditional `roundItemTitle` rendering outside its scope.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\styles.scss` (4/2/2026, 12:48:42):** Styles for various `rowType_` classes were expanded, including the introduction of `.roundItemTitle` within `.rowType_SQUARE_MINI` and comprehensive styling for `.item-show-all` elements.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (4/2/2026, 13:25:55 -> 13:34:44):** The `Page` component, responsible for fetching and displaying content, remained largely stable during this period, with primarily non-functional save operations. Its core logic includes real-time updates for live content (`refreshLives`), filtering children based on user type and platform capabilities, and robust error handling.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.scss` (4/2/2026, 14:02:04 -> 14:26:32):** The generic fixed focus styling received iterative updates, particularly in defining the `bigRound` focus shape. This included specifying its dimensions (275px x 275px), and repeatedly adjusting its `box-shadow` and `border` colors, eventually settling on a "kid-white" color with `!important` flags, along with updates to how `.page` styles apply to both `round` and `bigRound` focus.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.kids.scss` (4/2/2026, 14:18:09):** A new styling rule was added to provide specific `box-shadow`, `border-color`, and `outline` for focused elements within `.kid-mode` using a light purple color.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\index.jsx` (4/2/2026, 15:12:08 -> 15:17:01):** The `ExternalContentModal` component was enhanced to handle "partner" specific content. It now conditionally applies a `partner` class to its `popupLeft` section and dynamically adjusts the image height based on the `isPartner` prop.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss` (4/2/2026, 15:15:02):** New SCSS was added to define the layout and appearance of the external content modal, including styles for text rows, buttons, and a specific `.partner` style for the `popupLeft` element.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\libs\img.js` (5/2/2026, 9:38:25 -> 9:46:57):** The image utility library saw modifications to its `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` list, specifically adding `square-round` and `big-round` to ensure `getBestImageV2` correctly filters images based on desired aspect ratio. A duplicate `round` entry was also removed from `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **SmartTV Specifics:** A strong recurring theme is the adaptation and optimization for SmartTV platforms, including specialized keyboard navigation (WebOS, Tizen), platform-specific connection managers, and handling of various media types (live streams).
*   **UI/UX Refinement & Debugging:** Many files show rapid, iterative changes (especially `usersScreen/index.jsx`, `App.jsx`, `roundItem/index.jsx`, and associated `.scss` files) within short timeframes. This suggests an active phase of debugging, A/B testing, and fine-tuning of UI elements, navigation, and modal interactions. Common patterns include commenting/uncommenting code and slight value adjustments.
*   **Kid Mode / User Profiles:** There is a consistent emphasis on "kid-mode" or "Super3" profiles, evidenced by conditional logic (`isKidsProfile`, `activeUser?.type === UserType.KID`) and dedicated SCSS files (`.kids.scss`) for distinct styling of elements like round items and focus indicators.
*   **Focus Management:** Implementing and refining focus management for keyboard/remote navigation is critical for SmartTV apps, and is evident through `registerFocusAction`, `data-block-focus-*` attributes, and dedicated `fixedFocus` components and styles.
*   **Component-Based Development:** The widespread use of React hooks (`useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useState`, `useCallback`) highlights a component-driven architecture for the application.
*   **Image Handling:** Complex image selection and processing logic (`img.js`) is present, including image proxy usage and filtering based on format, aspect ratio, and source.

## 8:22:12
The provided logs show a series of code changes across a Smart TV application, primarily focusing on UI components, navigation, and platform-specific functionalities.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\3cat_pro\gateway\js\app.js` (Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 14:16:27)**
    *   This file defines the `init` function for a WebOS application gateway.
    *   It dynamically determines the `connectionmanager` service URL based on the `sdkVersion` (either `com.webos.service.connectionmanager` for SDK versions 3.00+ or `com.palm.connectionmanager` for older versions).
    *   The `REMOTE` URL for content delivery is also conditionally set: `https://smartv-dev.3cat.website/` for SDK < 3.50, and `https://smartv-pro.3cat.website/` for SDK >= 3.50.
    *   It checks for internet connection and redirects the user to the `REMOTE` URL if available. If not, it displays an alert and sets up a `keydown` listener for the `VK_BACK` button to exit the platform.
    *   It also subscribes to connection status changes to redirect once connectivity is restored.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx` (Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 16:31:34)**
    *   This React component (`InfoGroup`) handles the display of media information such as title, description, tags, age rating, and duration.
    *   Significant updates include:
        *   Introduction of `EpisodeCount` and `SeasonsCount` components for displaying episode/season numbers, with `EpisodeCount` having a `LIVE_REFRESH_INTERVAL` check (`CCMA-1685`).
        *   Commented out `Publication` component, indicating removal of "A partir del" functionality (`JIRA CCMA-2104`).
        *   Refinements to `showExpiration` logic, adding a prefix "Disponible fins a l'" or "Disponible fins al" based on the day.
        *   Enhanced logic for determining `title` and `description` from `item`, `default_episode`, and `stream` properties, including specific handling for live content, audio, and thematic channels.
        *   Improved `shouldShowProgramTitle` and `shouldShowEpisodeTitle` memoized logic for conditional rendering.
        *   Filtering of empty `rating_tags`.
        *   Updates to `dotSeparatedItems` to reflect the removal of `Publication`.
        *   New logic for `is_external` content, including `MediaTag` for live/white tags and displaying external platform logos.
        *   Extensive conditional rendering based on item properties (`isLive`, `isUpcomingEvent`, `is_licensed`, `tag_program`, `collection`).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\mediaTitle\styles.scss` (Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 16:33:36)**
    *   Styling for the `mediaTitle` component.
    *   Specific styles added for `.title_program`, `.live`, `.isLive_or_upcoming_event`, and `.stream` to adjust `font-weight` and `font-size` (38px).
    *   A new `.external` class was added, setting `font-size` to 56px.
    *   `.menu_detail` received a `font-weight: 700` and `font-size: 38px`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\portraitItem\styles.scss` (Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 16:39:57)**
    *   Styling for `.portraitItem`.
    *   Added styles for `:hover` and `.V-SCROLLABLE:not(.fixed) &.focused` to apply a red box-shadow, border-color, and outline, indicating focus/hover state.
    *   Introduced new styling for `.platform-logo` and its children (`.externalLogo`, `.externalIcon`) to display external platform information at the bottom of the item.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\keyboard\styles.scss` (Multiple timestamps: 2/2/2026, 16:56:08 and 2/2/2026, 17:09:25)**
    *   These changes involve slight adjustments to keyboard key styles. The second entry (17:09:25) adds a `:hover` state for `.keyboard-key` to match the `.focused` state, providing visual feedback on mouse-over.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (Multiple timestamps: 2/2/2026, 17:08:44 and 5/2/2026, 13:32:40)**
    *   This file manages generic keyboard navigation and player controls across Smart TV platforms.
    *   The first change (17:08:44) introduces a `THROTTLE_MS` (200ms) to prevent rapid key events, adds player-specific keys to `PLAYER_KEYS` set, and handles navigation events (`customNavigation`) for UP/DOWN keys when a user modal is not visible. It also includes platform-specific key handling for WebOS and Tizen.
    *   The later change (5/2/2026, 13:32:40) comments out the `e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation();` calls in `onKeyDownHandler` and also comments out `dispatchRewindEvent()` and `dispatchFastForwardEvent()` calls for platform-specific player controls, indicating a potential change in how these events are handled or a temporary disablement. The throttling logic (`if (now - lastTs < THROTTLE_MS) return;`) is also commented out.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps: 2/2/2026, 17:36:09 and 2/2/2026, 17:36:22)**
    *   Both entries are virtually identical, indicating a minor save or insignificant change.
    *   This React component (`SideMenu`) manages the application's main navigation menu.
    *   It initializes `window.AppMenu.vars` for menu state.
    *   Handles menu data generation based on user type (kid or adult).
    *   Includes logic for opening/closing menu levels, refreshing selected options based on the current path, and navigating to different routes.
    *   Introduces an `attachSearchAtTheBeginning` function to prepend a 'Search' option to the L1 menu data.
    *   The `manageFocused` function is crucial for navigation focus handling when interacting with the menu.
    *   Functions for changing users (`fnDoChangeUser`) and exiting the app (`fnExitApp`) are defined.
    *   `navigateTo` function handles route changes and updates `window.AppGlobal.Slider.wasSliderRowRendered` and `window.AppGlobal.AllCatalog.filter`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\onboarding\usersScreen\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps between 2/2/2026, 17:45:11 and 2/2/2026, 18:14:59)**
    *   This React component (`UsersScreen`) displays a list of users for selection (including "Super3" for kids and "Add User").
    *   There are several minor changes related to `window.__isEntry`:
        *   Initially, `window.__isEntry` is set based on `location.state?.isEntry || false`.
        *   Then it's set to `true` directly (18:05:33, 18:06:49, 18:10:38).
        *   Finally, it introduces a `window.__foceEntry` ref and `useEffect` to manage its value (18:14:59). This suggests an attempt to force a specific entry behavior, potentially for back button handling.
    *   The `PageHead` component's `onBackClick` is consistently set to `window.AppGlobal.Actions.openExitAppModal`.
    *   The `onSelectUser`, `onSelectKids`, and `onSelectAddUser` callbacks handle user selection and navigation.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\utils\goBackHistory.js` (Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 18:15:16)**
    *   Modified the `goBackHistory` function to check for `window.__isEntry` or `window.__foceEntry` when deciding whether to call `callBackFunc()` (which likely opens the exit app modal) or navigate back using `window.history.go(-1)`.
    *   It also includes specific logic for when a media player is active to hide its sub-menu or go back.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (Multiple timestamps between 2/2/2026, 18:50:50 and 2/2/2026, 19:14:36)**
    *   This is the main application file, defining routing and context providers.
    *   Repeated changes across these timestamps suggest frequent saves or minor reverts/tweaks related to the `openExitAppModal` function.
    *   Specifically, `openExitAppModal`'s logic for setting `window.isUserModalVisible` and `nav.storedFocus`, and `setExitModal(ModalTypes.EXIT)` is commented out and re-enabled a few times.
    *   The call to `window.AppMenu.manageFocused?.()` within `openExitAppModal` is present in some versions and removed in others (e.g., present at 18:52:39, removed at 18:54:07). This indicates a fluctuating approach to managing focus when an exit modal is opened.
    *   The core structure (BrowserRouter, Routes, Context Providers) remains consistent.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\tizen\3cat_pro\config.xml` (Multiple timestamps: 3/2/2026, 13:24:24, 5/2/2026, 10:47:12, and 5/2/2026, 11:41:17)**
    *   The `id` attribute of the `<widget>` element changed from `http://tizen.tv3.ccma.cat.qa` to `http://tizen.qa.ccma.cat` between 3/2 and 5/2.
    *   The `id` attribute of the `<tizen:application>` element changed from `PzkKxRdFT6.TV3.qa` to `PzkKxRdFT6qa.TV3` between 3/2 and 5/2.
    *   These changes likely reflect a shift in the application's identifier or domain within the Tizen build configuration, possibly related to a change in the QA environment setup. The content remains identical for the other elements across these changes.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 11:36:24 and 4/2/2026, 14:01:29)**
    *   Extensive modifications relate to handling round items, especially for "Kid Mode" and "Big Round" items.
    *   Initial changes introduced conditional image lookup for `isKidsProfile` to find `round` images, then changed to `big-round` for kid mode (12:08:06).
    *   The `isKidsProfile` check was removed from the `useMemo` for `image` and `type` determination (12:21:39), implying that the `roundItem` itself might no longer directly detect kid mode.
    *   Later changes (13:44:59 onwards) introduced an `isBigRound` prop, and the logic was updated to use `big-round` format images when `isBigRound` is true. The `className` and `data-nav-fixed-focus-shape` are also adjusted accordingly to handle `big-round` styling and focus.
    *   The `isKidsProfile` prop was removed from `RoundItem` (12:56:53).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.scss` (Timestamp: 4/2/2026, 13:53:09)**
    *   Introduced a new `.biground_row` style block for `.roundElement` to adjust width and height for larger round items. The `border: 5px solid white !important;` was changed to `border: none !important;` when `round-image` is present.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.kids.scss` (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:22:36 and 4/2/2026, 13:54:47)**
    *   Styling for `.roundElement` within `.kid-mode`.
    *   Initially set `background-color` to `$base-color-3cat-kid-bright-purple`.
    *   Then added a `border: 5px solid $base-color-3cat-kid-bright-purple !important;`.
    *   The border was later removed, then re-added, indicating iterative styling adjustments for kid mode.
    *   The final change (13:54:47) re-introduces the background color and border for `.roundElement` in kid mode.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.kids.scss` (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:26:49 and 4/2/2026, 14:14:40)**
    *   This file defines focus styles for "Kid Mode".
    *   There are numerous changes to the `.inner` box-shadow, border-color, and outline properties, often being added, removed, or tweaked, suggesting fine-tuning of visual focus indicators for kid mode.
    *   Specific styles for `&.round` were added, removed, and re-added.
    *   The final changes (14:14:22, 14:14:40) remove the outline for `&.round` and `&.bigRound` elements within `.kid-mode .fixed-focus .inner`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\rowUtils.js` (Multiple timestamps: 4/2/2026, 12:01:27 and 4/2/2026, 12:01:36)**
    *   Minor change: `rowData.format === 'square-mini'` was changed to `rowData.format === 'square_mini'` in the `getRowkind` function. This indicates a naming convention correction or update.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:02:26 and 4/2/2026, 12:54:35)**
    *   This component renders various types of rows in the UI.
    *   Updates include:
        *   Added `SQUARE_MINI` to `getRowElement` and `getShowAllElementsFocusShape` functions, indicating support for this new row item type.
        *   Removed conditional `isKidsProfile` rendering for `roundItemTitle` (12:54:35), suggesting that the `roundItemTitle` is now conditionally rendered directly within `RoundRow`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\styles.scss` (Timestamp: 4/2/2026, 12:48:42)**
    *   Introduced new styling for `&.rowType_SQUARE_MINI`, including specific `width`, `height`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom`, and styling for a `.roundItemTitle`. This is related to the addition of the `SQUARE_MINI` item type.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:27:53 and 4/2/2026, 13:42:39)**
    *   Refactored to handle "Kid Mode" and "Big Round" displays.
    *   Initially `textAlign` in `roundItemWrapper` was conditionally set based on `isKidsProfile` (12:27:53), then removed (12:30:58, 12:56:05, 12:57:05).
    *   The `isKidsProfile` prop was removed from `RoundRow` and `RoundItem` props.
    *   A new `isBigRound` prop was introduced, which is now used to conditionally apply a `biground_row` class to the row container (13:38:35).
    *   The `RoundItemTitle` component is now conditionally rendered directly within `RoundRow` when `isBigRound` is true (13:35:58).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\styles.scss` (Timestamp: 4/2/2026, 13:40:37)**
    *   Introduced `.biground_row` styles to define a different height (`calc(200px + 171px)`) compared to `.round_row` (`calc(200px + 70px)`).
    *   Consolidated common styles for `.round_row` and `.biground_row`.
    *   Added styles for `.roundItemTitle`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 13:25:55 and 4/2/2026, 13:34:44)**
    *   This component (`Page`) handles the display of a content page, including dynamic row rendering and live content updates.
    *   There were two identical commits within a short timeframe (13:25:55 and 13:26:44), implying a save without changes.
    *   The logic for `filterChildren` was updated to specifically filter out `user_row` items when `activeUser?.type === UserType.KID`, ensuring kid users don't see certain rows. This seems to be the main functional change in this file.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 15:12:08 and 4/2/2026, 15:17:01)**
    *   This modal displays details for external content.
    *   Introduced `isPartner` prop, based on `item.collection === 'partner'`, to apply different styles and image sizes for partner content.
    *   The `popupLeft` div now dynamically applies a `partner` class.
    *   The `generateImageData` call now considers `isPartner` when calculating the image height (428px for partner, 544px otherwise).
    *   Conditional rendering of `platformLogoContainer` based on `!isPartner`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss` (Timestamp: 4/2/2026, 15:15:02)**
    *   Added styling for `.popupLeft.partner` to adjust its height to 428px.
    *   Adjusted the `top` position of `.platformLogoContainer` to 544px.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\libs\img.js` (Multiple timestamps between 5/2/2026, 9:38:25 and 5/2/2026, 9:46:57)**
    *   This file provides utility functions for image handling, including `IMGPROXY_PRESETS` and functions to get optimized image URLs and best-fit images.
    *   The `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` array was modified:
        *   Initially, it had `round` listed twice (9:38:25, 9:38:51).
        *   Then `square-round` was added (9:38:51, 9:40:12, 9:40:33).
        *   Then `round` was removed as a duplicate (9:40:33).
        *   `big-round` was added to `notAllowedFomats` within `getBestImageV2` for landscape aspect (9:44:04). This prevents `big-round` images from being considered when searching for landscape or portrait images if they are not explicitly requested.
    *   These changes reflect adjustments to how different image formats are filtered and prioritized when selecting the "best" image for various display contexts.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

1.  **Kid Mode Integration:** There's a strong recurring theme of adapting UI components and behavior for "Kid Mode". This is evident in:
    *   `SideMenu`: Menu data generation (`settingsData.child_menu`).
    *   `UsersScreen`: "Super3" option and `setKidUser`.
    *   `Page`: Filtering `user_row` for kids (`activeUser?.type === UserType.KID`) and dynamic `homeId` selection.
    *   `RoundItem` and `RoundRow`: Specific styling and rendering logic for kid profiles (`isKidsProfile`, `isBigRound`), though `isKidsProfile` prop was later removed from `RoundItem` and `RoundRow`.
    *   SCSS files (`styles.kids.scss`): Dedicated styling files specifically for kid mode, applying different colors (e.g., `$base-color-3cat-kid-bright-purple`, `$base-color-3cat-kid-light-purple`, `$base-color-3cat-kid-white`) and focus aesthetics.
    *   `fixedFocus.scss`: `bigRound` focus styles use kid-mode colors (`$base-color-3cat-kid-white`).

2.  **Focus Management and Navigation (`nav`):** The `nav` object (likely a global navigation library) is heavily used across multiple components:
    *   `app.js`: `$(document).on('keydown', ...)` for `VK_BACK`.
    *   `generic.js`: `nav.move`, `nav.action`, `nav.focusById`, `nav.fixedFocus.isNavigating`, `nav.reset`, `nav.storedFocus`, `nav.getCurrentId`. Key combinations and player controls are also managed here.
    *   `SideMenu`: `nav.focusById`, `nav.storedFocus`, `nav.memory.setGroupLastFocusedID`.
    *   `RoundItem`, `GenericRow`: `registerFocusAction`, `unregisterFocusAction` for custom focus handling and `nav.focusById` on `onMouseOver`.
    *   `App.jsx`: `nav.storedFocus` is managed when opening/closing exit modals.
    *   `Page`: `nav.fixedFocus.isNavigating`, `nav.current.el`, `resetFixedFocus`.

3.  **Platform-Specific Logic:** The application frequently checks `window.AppGlobal.platform` to apply platform-specific behaviors and styling.
    *   `app.js`: Determines `connectionmanager` and `REMOTE` URL based on `sdkVersion` (WebOS/Palm).
    *   `generic.js`: Handles distinct key codes for WebOS and Tizen.
    *   `Page`: Filters children for `hbbtv` (external content) and disables certain rows if live/Shaka player is not supported.
    *   Tizen `config.xml` updates (`id`, `package`) also indicate platform-specific build configurations.

4.  **Content Display and Filtering:**
    *   `InfoGroup`: Complex logic for determining what information to display about media items (title, description, tags, duration, expiration, live status).
    *   `Page`: Dynamically filters rows (`filterChildren`) based on user type (kid), platform capabilities (live/Shaka player support), and external content status.
    *   `img.js`: Extensive image handling, including `IMGPROXY_PRESETS`, `getImgProxyUrl`, `removeItemsFromArray`, `getBestImage`, `getBestImageV2`, `getLogoImage`, `getImageByFormat`, and `generateImageData`. This suggests a sophisticated system for optimizing and serving images based on context (width, height, desired format, external status, text presence, etc.).

5.  **Modal Management:**
    *   `App.jsx`: Manages `ExitAppModal` state and actions (`openExitAppModal`, `closeExitAppModal`, `handleCancel`, `handleOk`).
    *   `Page`: Uses `UserModal` and `ExternalContentModal`.
    *   `goBackHistory.js`: Checks `window.isUserModalVisible` to control back navigation.

6.  **Component Reusability:** Many components (e.g., `GenericRow`, `RoundItem`, `PageHead`, `Spinner`, `Button`, `MediaTag`, `MediaTitle`) are used across different views, implying a modular architecture.

7.  **Timestamp Clustering:** Many changes, especially in UI-related SCSS and React components (`RoundItem`, `RoundRow`, `fixedFocus.kids.scss`, `usersScreen`, `App.jsx`, `img.js`), occur in rapid succession within the same hour or minutes (e.g., 4/2/2026, 12:xx:xx to 14:xx:xx), indicating active development, testing, and fine-tuning of visual and interactive elements. The `App.jsx` and `usersScreen` files show particularly frequent, small changes, suggesting detailed iteration on core application flow and user management.

## 9:21:49
The file `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\FREE FIRE\Free Free Root Go To 2k\PS MODDER YT\app\src\main\jni\Unity\Unity.h`, last modified on `8/2/2026, 9:19:06`, is a C++ header file integral to a project likely focused on modifying or interacting with a Unity-based game, given its location in a "PS MODDER YT" directory.

Key updates and content for this file include:
*   **Android NDK Integration and Logging:** It incorporates `android/log.h` and defines custom logging macros (`LOGE`, `LOGW`, `LOGD`, `LOGI`) using the tag `"PusexPrivate.Xyz"`, indicating a native Android application or library.
*   **3D Math Utilities:** The file provides essential 3D mathematics functions, including `NormalizeAngle` and `NormalizeAngles` for keeping angles within a standard range, `ToEulerRad` for converting quaternions to Euler angles while handling edge cases, and `GetRotationToLocation` to calculate rotations towards a target. These are crucial for handling game object orientations, movement, and aiming.
*   **Unity Mono Runtime Structures:** A significant portion of the file defines template structures such as `monoArray`, `monoList`, `monoDictionary`, and `monoString`. These structures are explicitly designed to mirror the internal data representations used by Unity's Mono runtime, allowing for direct memory access and manipulation of game data.
*   **Game-Specific Context:** The presence of commented-out `Transform` structures with obfuscated names like `{vps^o`, `s^uN~t`, `sqdz[Xb` and descriptive comments like `// Hand`, `// Head`, `// Hip`, `// Toe`, `// LShoulder`, `//RShoulder` strongly suggests a focus on reverse engineering or modding a game's character models and their bone structures, potentially for features like an aimbot or ESP (Extra Sensory Perception).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
The content consistently reveals an effort to interface deeply with a Unity game's internal mechanics. The recurring theme is the implementation of low-level data structures and mathematical functions directly relevant to game engine operations (3D transformations, object lists, dictionaries, strings), coupled with indications of direct memory access and manipulation, characteristic of game modding or hacking tools. The file path itself (e.g., `PS MODDER YT`, `FREE FIRE`) reinforces this interpretation.

## 9:22:09
The code changes reflect a focus on the 3Cat smart TV application, primarily in JavaScript and SCSS files. Key changes occurred between February 2nd and February 5th, 2026.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\3cat_pro\gateway\js\app.js` (2/2/2026, 14:16:27):**
    *   Updated the `init` function to dynamically determine the `connectionmanager` service (WebOS vs. Palm) based on `sdkVersion`.
    *   Introduced logic to change the `REMOTE` URL for SDK versions less than 3.5.0 (switching from `smartv-dev.3cat.website` to `smartv-pro.3cat.website`).
    *   Improved network status handling: if no internet, it shows an alert and registers a `VK_BACK` keydown event to `webOS.platformBack()`. It also subscribes to connection status changes to redirect to `REMOTE + query` when available.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx` (2/2/2026, 16:31:34):**
    *   Introduced `EpisodeCount` and `SeasonsCount` components for displaying episode/season numbers, with a note about JIRA CCMA-1685.
    *   Commented out `Publication` component, noting "JIRA CCMA-2104: Eliminamos funcionalidad 'A partir del'" (Removed 'Available from' functionality).
    *   Added logic to `showExpiration` for displaying expiration dates within three months, with specific Catalan prefixes.
    *   Enhanced `title` and `description` retrieval logic to handle various item types (default episode, live streams, audio, thematic, external content).
    *   Refined `shouldShowProgramTitle` and `shouldShowEpisodeTitle` conditions for displaying titles based on `logoImage`, `is_episode`, `tag_format`, and `collection`.
    *   Added `is_external` and `external_content_data` checks for rendering external platform logos and media tags.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\mediaTitle\styles.scss` (2/2/2026, 16:33:36):**
    *   Defined base styling for `.mediaTitle` (color, font, text shadow, clamping).
    *   Added specific styles for `.title_program`, `.live`, `.isLive_or_upcoming_event`, `.stream`, `.menu_detail`, and `.external` classes, mostly adjusting font-weight and font-size.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\portraitItem\styles.scss` (2/2/2026, 16:39:57):**
    *   Updated styling for `.portraitItem`, including focused states with a red box-shadow/outline.
    *   Added styling for a `.tag` element (white background, black text, rounded corners, absolute positioning).
    *   Introduced `.platform-logo` styles for displaying external platform logos at the bottom left of the item.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\keyboard\styles.scss` (2/2/2026, 16:56:08 & 2/2/2026, 17:09:25):**
    *   Initial creation and minor adjustment of keyboard styles.
    *   Defined layout for `.keyboard` and `.keyboard-row`.
    *   Detailed styling for `.keyboard-key` elements, including various sizes (`.SMALL`, `.MEDIUM`, `.LARGE`), icons (backspace, spacebar, return), and a distinct focused state with a red glow and border.
    *   The second timestamp adds a `:hover` state identical to the `.focused` state.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (2/2/2026, 17:08:44 & 5/2/2026, 13:32:40):**
    *   Initialized `window.AppGlobal.KeyMemory` for handling key combinations.
    *   Defined `window.AppGlobal.keyCombinations` for ad enabling/disabling via specific key sequences (e.g., "123", "321", player buttons).
    *   `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartTV` function handles keydown events for navigation (up, down, left, right, enter) and back/escape actions, which can open an exit app modal.
    *   Includes platform-specific key handling for WebOS and Tizen (play, pause, stop, rewind, fast forward).
    *   The second change on 5/2/2026, 13:32:40, notably comments out `e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation();` at the beginning of `onKeyDownHandler` and also comments out the `dispatchRewindEvent()` and `dispatchFastForwardEvent()` calls within the platform-specific key handling. It also removes the `THROTTLE_MS` and related `lastTs` throttling logic.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\index.jsx` (2/2/2026, 17:36:09 & 2/2/2026, 17:36:22):**
    *   Established `window.AppMenu` for managing menu state (selected level 1/2, `justArrived`).
    *   Handles menu visibility, authentication context, settings, and dynamic menu data generation based on user type (kid/adult).
    *   Includes `attachSearchAtTheBeginning` to prepend a search option to the menu.
    *   Manages menu opening/closing and navigation between main and sub-menus (Explore, User).
    *   The second timestamp on 2/2/2026, 17:36:22, adds `window.__isEntry = isMenuVisible;` within a `useEffect` hook. Otherwise, the changes are minimal and seem to be a re-save or minor formatting.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\onboarding\usersScreen\index.jsx` (multiple timestamps between 2/2/2026, 17:45:11 and 2/2/2026, 18:14:59):**
    *   Manages user selection, including regular users, "Super3" (kid mode), and adding new users.
    *   Sets up navigation to `/home`, `/usersScreen`, or `/addUserScreen`.
    *   Handles `isLoading` state with a `Spinner`.
    *   The `onBackClick` for `PageHead` was changed from `window.__isEntry ? window.AppGlobal.Actions.openExitAppModal : undefined` to `window.AppGlobal.Actions.openExitAppModal` at 18:04:11.
    *   A significant change at 18:05:33, where `window.__isEntry = location.state?.isEntry || false;` was explicitly changed to `window.__isEntry = true;` and then commented out at 18:06:13, with `window.__isEntry = true;` moved into a `useEffect` hook at 18:10:38.
    *   At 18:14:59, `window.__isEntry = true;` and its usage in `onBackClick` were removed, and `window.__foceEntry = true;` was introduced within its own `useEffect` for force-entry behavior, with a cleanup function to set it back to `false`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\utils\goBackHistory.js` (2/2/2026, 18:15:16):**
    *   Modified the `goBackHistory` function to check for `window.__isEntry` or `window.__foceEntry` to trigger a `callBackFunc()` (likely an exit app modal). This indicates a new mechanism for handling app exit on specific entry points.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (multiple timestamps between 2/2/2026, 18:50:50 and 2/2/2026, 19:14:36):**
    *   The main application component, defining routing, context providers, and global actions.
    *   Includes `InitDevConsole` and `BuildInfo` components for debugging and displaying build information.
    *   `AppInner` manages exit/logout modals.
    *   Multiple small changes across timestamps primarily involve commenting/uncommenting lines related to `window.isUserModalVisible` and `window.AppMenu.manageFocused()` within the `openExitAppModal` function. Some instances of `window.AppMenu?.exitMenu?.()` were added or removed.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\tizen\3cat_pro\config.xml` (3/2/2026, 13:24:24 & 5/2/2026, 10:47:12 & 5/2/2026, 11:41:17):**
    *   XML configuration for a Tizen application.
    *   Changes involve updating the `id` attribute of the `<widget>` element from `http://tizen.tv3.ccma.cat.qa` to `http://tizen.qa.ccma.cat` at 5/2/2026, 10:47:12. This suggests a change in the application's unique identifier, possibly related to deployment environments.
    *   The `package` and `id` attributes of `<tizen:application>` were also updated accordingly. The content itself is generally stable apart from these identifiers.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx` (multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 11:36:24 and 4/2/2026, 14:01:29):**
    *   Component for displaying round items in rows.
    *   Initially had logic to differentiate image formats for `isKidsProfile`. This logic was commented out at 4/2/2026, 12:21:39, meaning `isKidsProfile` no longer affects the `image_format` lookup directly within this component, only the `type` for CSS classing.
    *   The `isKidsProfile` prop was removed from the component at 4/2/2026, 12:56:53.
    *   Re-introduced `isBigRound` prop at 4/2/2026, 13:35:58, which affects image format lookup (for `big-round`) and CSS classes.
    *   Modified `data-nav-fixed-focus-shape` attribute to dynamically use `'bigRound'` or `'round'` based on `isBigRound` at 4/2/2026, 14:01:29.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\rowUtils.js` (4/2/2026, 12:01:27 & 4/2/2026, 12:01:36):**
    *   Function `getRowkind` determines the type of row based on `rowData` properties.
    *   Changed `rowData.format === 'square-mini'` to `rowData.format === 'square_mini'` for `ROUND` row kind at 4/2/2026, 12:01:36 (a minor string format correction).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (4/2/2026, 12:02:26 & 4/2/2026, 12:49:54 & 4/2/2026, 12:54:35 & 4/2/2026, 13:22:28):**
    *   `getRowElement` and `getShowAllElementsFocusShape` functions determine the item component and focus shape based on `rowType`.
    *   `generateShowAllElements` creates the "Show All" item for rows with more content.
    *   Added `case 'SQUARE_MINI': return SquareItem;` to `getRowElement` and `case 'SQUARE_MINI': return 'square';` to `getShowAllElementsFocusShape` at 4/2/2026, 12:49:54.
    *   A line `<div className="roundItemTitle">{item.title}</div>` was added conditional on `isKidsProfile` at 4/2/2026, 12:49:54, and then removed at 4/2/2026, 12:54:35. This suggests an attempt to conditionally render titles for kid profiles within generic rows, which was reverted.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.kids.scss` (multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:22:36 and 4/2/2026, 14:12:14):**
    *   Styles for kid mode `.roundElement` items.
    *   Initially set a purple background and border at 4/2/2026, 12:22:48 and 12:23:43.
    *   These properties (`background-color`, `border`) were frequently added and removed, indicating active experimentation with kid-mode styling for round items.
    *   The `border` property was re-added and then removed multiple times, suggesting a back-and-forth decision on whether kid-mode round items should have a distinct border. The final state at 4/2/2026, 14:12:14, only sets `background-color`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.kids.scss` (multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:26:49 and 4/2/2026, 14:14:40):**
    *   Styles for the fixed focus indicator in kid mode.
    *   Frequent changes in `box-shadow`, `outline`, and `border-color` for the `.inner` element, typically using `$base-color-3cat-kid-light-purple`.
    *   Introduced and removed a specific `.round` selector within `kid-mode .fixed-focus` multiple times, adjusting its `width`, `height`, `box-shadow`, and `border`.
    *   Later, modified the `.round` selector to `.round, &.big-round` and set `outline: 0px;` at 4/2/2026, 14:14:22 and 14:14:40, indicating that round and big-round focus elements in kid mode should have no outline.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\index.jsx` (multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:27:53 and 4/2/2026, 13:42:39):**
    *   Removes `isKidsProfile` from being passed to `RoundItem` at 4/2/2026, 12:30:58.
    *   Reintroduces `isBigRound` prop at 4/2/2026, 13:35:58, which affects `textAlign` of `roundItemWrapper` and also conditionally renders a `roundItemTitle`.
    *   Changes the main div's class name to dynamically be `biground_row` or `round_row` based on `isBigRound` at 4/2/2026, 13:38:35.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\styles.scss` (4/2/2026, 12:28:04 & 4/2/2026, 13:40:37):**
    *   Initial styling for `.round_row` and its inner elements.
    *   The second update at 4/2/2026, 13:40:37, introduces `.biground_row` with a different height, and consolidates common styles for both `round_row` and `biground_row`, including adding styles for `roundItemTitle`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\styles.kids.scss` (4/2/2026, 12:30:18):**
    *   A commented-out style for `height` in `.kid-mode .round_row`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.scss` (multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 14:02:04 and 4/2/2026, 14:26:32):**
    *   Added a new `.bigRound` focus shape with specific `width`, `height`, `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, and `border`.
    *   Initially used `$base-color-3cat-red` for `.bigRound` at 14:02:04, then changed to `$base-color-3cat-kid-light-purple` at 14:02:35.
    *   Later changed `box-shadow` and `border` for `.bigRound` to use `$base-color-3cat-kid-white` with `!important` at 14:26:06.
    *   Updated the `.page` section to include `.bigRound` alongside `.round` for `fixed-focus` positioning at 14:09:26.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.kids.scss` (4/2/2026, 14:18:09):**
    *   Added a new style for `.V-SCROLLABLE:not(.fixed) .focused` in `kid-mode`, applying a purple box-shadow and border.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\index.jsx` (4/2/2026, 15:12:08 & 4/2/2026, 15:15:17 & 4/2/2026, 15:17:01):**
    *   Initial creation of the `ExternalContentModal` component for displaying details of external content.
    *   Uses `PopupInfoGroup`, `GenericButton`, `ImageCropper`, and various icons.
    *   Focuses on `btn-open-external` on mount and restores focus on unmount.
    *   At 15:15:17, added `partner` class dynamically to `popupLeft` based on `isPartner`.
    *   At 15:17:01, `generateImageData` call adjusted `h` parameter to `isPartner ? 428 : 544`, indicating a different image height for partner content.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss` (4/2/2026, 15:15:02):**
    *   Styles for the external content modal, defining its overlay, popup layout, left (image) and right (info, buttons) sections.
    *   Includes specific styles for `promoTextRow` and `platformTextRow`.
    *   Added `.partner` style to `popupLeft` to adjust height for partner content.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\libs\img.js` (multiple timestamps between 5/2/2026, 9:38:25 and 5/2/2026, 9:46:57):**
    *   Utility functions for image handling, including `getImgProxyUrl`, `removeItemsFromArray`, `getBestImage`, `getBestImageV2`, `getLogoImage`, `getImageByFormat`, `generateImageData`, and `generateImageDataFromLiveChannelInHome_v2`.
    *   Frequent modifications to `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` array, especially in `getBestImageV2`, where `square-round` and `big-round` image formats were added to the list of formats to exclude for landscape images, then `square-round` was removed and re-added to `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` in `getBestImage`.
    *   The `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` array for `getBestImage` was `['logo', 'triangular', 'logo-greyscale', 'white-logo', 'round', 'round',]` and then changed to `['logo', 'triangular', 'logo-greyscale', 'white-logo', 'round']` (removed a duplicate 'round') at 9:44:04.
    *   `getBestImageV2` consistently adds `portrait`, `portrait-audio`, `square-audio`, `square-round`, `big-round`, and `portrait-english` to a local `notAllowedFomats` array if the desired aspect is 'LANDSCAPE'.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

1.  **Kid Mode / User Type Specifics:** Many changes revolve around distinguishing between "kid mode" (Super3) and regular user mode. This includes:
    *   Conditional rendering of menu items (`SideMenu`).
    *   Conditional fetching of home data (`Page`).
    *   Specific styling for focused items (`fixedFocus.kids.scss`, `App.kids.scss`).
    *   Image format selection (`roundItem/index.jsx`, `img.js`).
    *   Filtering of content rows (`Page`).

2.  **Focus Management and Keyboard Navigation:**
    *   Extensive use of `nav.focusById`, `registerFocusAction`, `unregisterFocusAction` across components (`RoundItem`, `GenericRow`, `SideMenu`, `ExternalContentModal`, `UsersScreen`).
    *   `fixedFocus.scss` and `fixedFocus.kids.scss` define various focus shapes and their styling, with frequent adjustments, particularly for round and "big round" items.
    *   `platform\generic.js` shows a robust keyboard navigation system, including custom key combinations and platform-specific key handling for Smart TVs.

3.  **UI/UX Refinements for Content Display:**
    *   Components like `infoGroup`, `mediaTitle`, `portraitItem`, `roundItem`, `genericRow`, and `externalContentModal` received updates to how content details (titles, descriptions, dates, logos, external links) are displayed and styled.
    *   Introduction of "Show All" elements in rows (`genericRow`) to handle more items than initially displayed.
    *   Dynamic sizing and styling of elements based on content type (`externalContentModal`, `roundRow`).

4.  **Application Lifecycle and Modals:**
    *   `App.jsx` and `SideMenu.jsx` frequently deal with application state, user authentication, and the presentation/handling of various modals (exit app, logout, external content, user selection).
    *   The `openExitAppModal` function and related `window.isUserModalVisible` state are recurring elements in the `App.jsx` and `generic.js` changes, indicating a common mechanism for handling application exit or modal visibility.
    *   The `window.__isEntry` and `window.__foceEntry` flags in `usersScreen` and `goBackHistory` suggest mechanisms for controlling back navigation behavior, especially when the app is launched directly into certain screens or is in a "force entry" state.

5.  **Image Handling and Optimization (`src\libs\img.js`):**
    *   The `img.js` file is heavily modified, especially `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` and `getBestImageV2`. This indicates ongoing work on selecting and displaying optimal images based on aspect ratio, size, and specific image formats, with a clear separation for logo and "round" image types, and further refinements for different screen orientations and content types.

6.  **Platform Specifics:**
    *   Explicit checks for `window.AppGlobal.platform` (`webos`, `tizen`, `hbbtv`) are present in `generic.js` for key handling and in `Page.jsx` for content filtering.
    *   The `config.xml` for Tizen shows platform-specific application metadata and privileges.

Overall, the changes indicate active development on a smart TV application, focusing on improving user experience (navigation, content display), adapting to different user profiles (kid mode), and ensuring platform compatibility and robust error handling. The frequent modifications to styling and image utilities suggest a strong emphasis on visual presentation and performance.

## 10:22:22
The log details a series of code changes, primarily focusing on a Smart TV application and its gateway, occurring between February 2nd, 2026, and February 5th, 2026. Many changes involve UI components, navigation, and platform-specific adaptations, particularly for Tizen and WebOS.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\3cat_pro\gateway\js\app.js` (2/2/2026, 14:16:27):**
    *   The `init` function was updated to dynamically determine the `connectionmanager` service URL (WebOS or Palm) and `REMOTE` website ('https://smartv-dev.3cat.website/' or 'https://smartv-pro.3cat.website/') based on the device's `sdkVersion`.
    *   It now checks for internet connectivity: if available, it navigates to the `REMOTE` URL; otherwise, it displays an alert and sets up a `keydown` listener for the back button and a subscription to `connectionmanager` status changes to redirect once connectivity is restored.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx` (2/2/2026, 16:31:34):**
    *   Extensive logic was added or modified for displaying media information within `InfoGroup` components.
    *   New components `EpisodeCount` and `SeasonsCount` were introduced to show episode/season numbers, with `EpisodeCount` having a limit based on `LIVE_REFRESH_INTERVAL` (CCMA-1685).
    *   Commented out `Publication` component, indicating removal of 'A partir del' (available from) functionality (JIRA CCMA-2104).
    *   Improved `showExpiration` logic to display "Disponible fins a l'/al [formattedDate]" (Available until the [formattedDate]) only if the unpublished date is within the next three months.
    *   Enhanced `title` and `description` retrieval logic, including specific handling for live content, audio, and "link" collections.
    *   Refined conditions for showing program titles, episode titles, and media tags.
    *   Introduced `is_external` and `external_content_data` handling for external platform logos and tags.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\mediaTitle\styles.scss` (2/2/2026, 16:33:36):**
    *   Updated styling for `.mediaTitle`, including font properties, `text-shadow`, and `max-width`.
    *   Added specific styles for `&.title_program`, `&.live`, `&.isLive_or_upcoming_event`, `&.stream`, and `&.menu_detail` to adjust font weight and size. A new style `&.external` was added with `font-size: 56px;`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\portraitItem\styles.scss` (2/2/2026, 16:39:57):**
    *   Added styles for `.platform-logo` and its child elements (`.externalLogo`, `.externalIcon`) to display external platform information at the bottom of portrait items. This includes `width`, `height`, `background`, `padding`, and `object-fit` properties.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\keyboard\styles.scss` (2/2/2026, 16:56:08 & 2/2/2026, 17:09:25):**
    *   Initial creation of styles for a virtual keyboard (`.keyboard`, `.keyboard-row`, `.keyboard-key`).
    *   Defined various key sizes (`.SMALL`, `.MEDIUM`, `.LARGE`) and specific icon styles (`.icon-BACKSPACE`, `.icon-SPACE_BAR`, `.icon-RETURN`).
    *   Included a `&.focused` state with a red box-shadow and border for visual feedback.
    *   The second timestamp adds a `:hover` state identical to the `&.focused` state, indicating an enhancement for mouse interaction or general focus visual.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (2/2/2026, 17:08:44 & 5/2/2026, 13:32:40):**
    *   The `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartTV` function was created/modified to handle keyboard navigation for Smart TV platforms.
    *   It defines global key memory (`window.AppGlobal.KeyMemory`) for combination detection (e.g., "979899" for enabling ads).
    *   Sets up `nav.actionFunction` to simulate a click on the currently focused element.
    *   Implements a `onKeyDownHandler` with key throttling (`THROTTLE_MS`).
    *   Handles common navigation keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, ENTER) and back/exit keys (`VK_BACK`, `VK_ESCAPE`, `VK_BACK_SPACE`), including platform-specific key codes for WebOS and Tizen (e.g., play/pause/stop/seek actions).
    *   **Significant change on 5/2/2026, 13:32:40**: The `e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation();` lines were removed from the `onKeyDownHandler`, and the throttle check (`if (now - lastTs < THROTTLE_MS) return;`) was commented out. Additionally, `dispatchRewindEvent()` and `dispatchFastForwardEvent()` calls within the WebOS, Tizen, and 'Other platforms' sections for player controls were commented out. This suggests a change in how keyboard events are handled, potentially allowing default browser behavior or adjusting input responsiveness, and deferring rewind/fast-forward actions.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\index.jsx` (2/2/2026, 17:36:09 & 2/2/2026, 17:36:22):**
    *   Both timestamps show the exact same code, indicating a minor save or revert without functional changes.
    *   This component manages the application's side menu, including L1 (main) and L2 (sub) levels.
    *   It uses React hooks for state management and interacts with `useAuthContext`, `useSettings`, `useCapabilitiesContext`, and `useVirtualizationContext`.
    *   Implements `AppMenuCreate` for global menu variables and various functions for opening/closing menu levels, handling navigation, and user actions (change user, exit app).
    *   The `refreshSelectedOption` function determines the currently selected menu item based on the current `location.pathname`.
    *   Includes logic to `attachSearchAtTheBeginning` of the main menu data.
    *   Handles user type (Kid vs. Adult) for menu data generation (`settingsData.child_menu` vs. `settingsData.menu`).
    *   Mouse interaction handlers (`onMouseOverUserMenu`, `onMouseOverExploraMenu`) are present.
    *   Navigation logic (`navigateTo`) correctly dispatches `menu:navigate` events and updates `window.AppGlobal.Slider.wasSliderRowRendered` and `window.AppGlobal.AllCatalog.filter`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\onboarding\usersScreen\index.jsx` (multiple timestamps between 2/2/2026, 17:45:11 and 2/2/2026, 18:14:59):**
    *   The core functionality of `UsersScreen` allows selecting a user, a kids profile ("Super3"), or adding a new user. It handles navigation to `/home`, `/addUserScreen`, or `/qrAuthScreen`.
    *   **2/2/2026, 17:45:11**: `window.__isEntry` is set based on `location.state?.isEntry`. The `PageHead`'s `onBackClick` is conditionally set to `window.AppGlobal.Actions.openExitAppModal` if `window.__isEntry` is true.
    *   **2/2/2026, 18:04:11**: `onBackClick` is unconditionally set to `window.AppGlobal.Actions.openExitAppModal`. The conditional check for `window.__isEntry` was removed from the `onBackClick` prop.
    *   **2/2/2026, 18:04:19**: Reinstated the conditional call to `exitKidMode()` within `useEffect` if `isLoading` is true, which was previously commented out.
    *   **2/2/2026, 18:05:33**: `window.__isEntry` is hardcoded to `true`, overriding the `location.state` value.
    *   **2/2/2026, 18:06:13**: The `location` import and `window.__isEntry` assignment are commented out, making `window.__isEntry` undefined or relying on it being set elsewhere.
    *   **2/2/2026, 18:06:49**: `window.__isEntry = true;` (hardcoded) is brought back, effectively making `window.__isEntry` always true for this screen. The `location` import and usage are reinstated.
    *   **2/2/2026, 18:09:47**: `window.__isEntry` is again assigned from `location.state?.isEntry || false;` reverting the hardcoded `true` value. The comments around `location` import were removed.
    *   **2/2/2026, 18:10:38**: `window.__isEntry = true;` is placed inside the `useEffect` hook that runs on initial load (or when `isLoading` changes), again hardcoding it to `true` after the initial render.
    *   **2/2/2026, 18:14:59**: `window.__isEntry` is removed. A new global variable `window.__foceEntry = true;` is introduced in a `useEffect` that runs once, with a cleanup function to set it to `false`. This likely indicates a new mechanism to force entry-point behavior.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\utils\goBackHistory.js` (2/2/2026, 18:15:16):**
    *   The `goBackHistory` utility function was updated. It now checks `window.__isEntry` or the newly introduced `window.__foceEntry` to trigger a `callBackFunc()` instead of navigating back, preventing history navigation from certain entry points.
    *   Also handles cases for media player (hiding audio/subs menu) and general history `go(-1)`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (multiple timestamps between 2/2/2026, 18:50:50 and 2/2/2026, 19:14:36):**
    *   The `App` component sets up the main routing for the application, including public and private routes.
    *   **2/2/2026, 18:51:35**: The `openExitAppModal` function was modified. The lines `window.isUserModalVisible = true; nav.storedFocus = nav.getCurrentId(); setExitModal(ModalTypes.EXIT);` were commented out. This change implies that `openExitAppModal` now only calls `window.AppMenu?.exitMenu?.()` and does not directly control the `ExitAppModal` visibility or focus, likely deferring that responsibility.
    *   **2/2/2026, 18:52:39**: The `openExitAppModal` function was further modified to include `window.AppMenu.manageFocused?.();` after `window.AppMenu?.exitMenu?.()`, which was re-added from previous commenting. The original lines for `window.isUserModalVisible`, `nav.storedFocus`, and `setExitModal` remain commented out. This suggests attempts to refine how exiting the app interacts with the menu and focus management.
    *   **2/2/2026, 18:54:07**: The lines related to setting `window.isUserModalVisible`, `nav.storedFocus`, and `setExitModal(ModalTypes.EXIT)` in `openExitAppModal` were *uncommented*, restoring the direct control of the exit modal. `window.AppMenu.manageFocused?.();` was removed again. This indicates a revert or rethink on modal visibility and focus handling.
    *   **2/2/2026, 19:14:36**: No functional code changes from the previous timestamp (2/2/2026, 18:54:07).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\tizen\3cat_pro\config.xml` (3/2/2026, 13:24:24, 5/2/2026, 10:47:12, 5/2/2026, 11:41:17):**
    *   **3/2/2026, 13:24:24**: Initial config showing Tizen application ID `PzkKxRdFT6.TV3.qa`, package `PzkKxRdFT6qa`, and widget ID `http://tizen.tv3.ccma.cat.qa`.
    *   **5/2/2026, 10:47:12**: The `id` attribute of the `<widget>` element was changed from `http://tizen.tv3.ccma.cat.qa` to `http://tizen.qa.ccma.cat`. The `id` attribute of `<tizen:application>` was also updated to `PzkKxRdFT6qa.TV3`. These changes seem to reflect a shift in the application's unique identifier, possibly from a specific "tv3.ccma.cat.qa" domain to a more general "qa.ccma.cat" within the Tizen configuration.
    *   **5/2/2026, 11:41:17**: No functional code changes from the previous timestamp.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx` (multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 11:36:24 and 4/2/2026, 14:01:29):**
    *   This component displays items in a round format, often for categories or user profiles.
    *   **4/2/2026, 11:36:24**: Initial version, includes `isKidsProfile` prop, but the image selection logic is commented out for `isKidsProfile`.
    *   **4/2/2026, 11:41:47**: The image selection logic for `isKidsProfile` was uncommented and refined: if `isKidsProfile` is true, it explicitly looks for an image with `image_format === 'round'`.
    *   **4/2/2026, 12:08:06**: Changed the `image_format` lookup for `isKidsProfile` from `'round'` to `'big-round'`.
    *   **4/2/2026, 12:21:39**: Removed the `isKidsProfile` conditional logic from the `useMemo` hook, making image selection consistent regardless of kid profile. The `className` still uses `type === 'round'`.
    *   **4/2/2026, 12:56:53**: Removed `isKidsProfile` from the component's props and the `useMemo` dependency array, simplifying the image logic to always look for 'round' or 'logo' images.
    *   **4/2/2026, 13:44:19**: `isKidsProfile` prop reintroduced to `RoundItem`, and the image selection logic for `isKidsProfile` was reverted to explicitly look for `image_format === 'round'`.
    *   **4/2/2026, 13:44:59**: Replaced `isKidsProfile` with `isBigRound` in props and related logic. If `isBigRound` is true, it looks for `'round'` format and sets `type` to `'big-round'`.
    *   **4/2/2026, 13:45:13 & 4/2/2026, 13:45:24**: Minor class name adjustments `(type === 'round' || type === '-round')` to `(type === 'round' || type === 'big-round')` in the `className` for `roundElement`, and an incorrect `type === '-round'` in the `img` style. Corrected to `(type === 'round' || type === 'big-round')` in the `img` style, indicating refinement for styling based on `big-round` type.
    *   **4/2/2026, 13:48:20**: In `useMemo`, if `isBigRound` is true, it now explicitly searches for `image_format === 'big-round'` to get the image, instead of just `'round'`.
    *   **4/2/2026, 14:01:29**: The `data-nav-fixed-focus-shape` attribute was updated to dynamically apply either `'bigRound'` or `'round'` based on the `isBigRound` prop, enhancing focus styling for larger round items.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\rowUtils.js` (4/2/2026, 12:01:27 & 4/2/2026, 12:01:36):**
    *   **4/2/2026, 12:01:36**: Corrected a typo in `getRowkind` function: `rowData.format === 'square-mini'` changed to `rowData.format === 'square_mini'`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:02:26 and 4/2/2026, 12:54:35):**
    *   This component is a versatile row renderer for different item types.
    *   **4/2/2026, 12:02:26**: `getRowElement` and `getShowAllElementsFocusShape` functions determine the appropriate item component and focus shape based on `rowType`. It includes logic for `LANDSCAPE_MINI`, `MINI`, `SQUARE`, `PORTRAIT`, `INLINE`, `FEATURED`, `HERO`, `USER_ROW`, `LIVE_TV`, `LAST_DAYS`, and `LANDSCAPE`.
    *   The `generateShowAllElements` function creates a "show all" item at the end of rows if `moreRowItemsAvailable`.
    *   The component maps `rowItems` to `RowElement` components, passing props including navigation, focus actions, and `isKidsProfile`.
    *   **4/2/2026, 12:49:54**: Modified `getRowElement` and `getShowAllElementsFocusShape` to include `case 'SQUARE_MINI'` (which currently defaults to `SquareItem` and `'square'`). This formalizes handling for `square_mini` row types.
    *   **4/2/2026, 12:54:35**: The conditional rendering of `<div className="roundItemTitle">{item.title}</div>` when `isKidsProfile` is true was removed from this component. This title rendering for round items in kid mode was likely moved to the `RoundRow` component directly.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.kids.scss` (multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:22:36 and 4/2/2026, 13:54:47):**
    *   This stylesheet defines specific styles for `roundElement` in kid mode.
    *   **4/2/2026, 12:22:36**: Initial style for `roundElement` in kid mode, with `background-color` commented out.
    *   **4/2/2026, 12:22:48**: Uncommented `background-color: $base-color-3cat-kid-bright-purple;`.
    *   **4/2/2026, 12:23:43**: Added `border: 5px solid $base-color-3cat-kid-bright-purple !important;` to `roundElement`.
    *   **4/2/2026, 12:25:30**: Removed the explicit `border` property, reverting to only `background-color`.
    *   **4/2/2026, 13:54:47**: Re-added `border: 5px solid $base-color-3cat-kid-bright-purple !important;` to `roundElement` in kid mode. This indicates an iterative process of styling adjustments for kid-mode round elements.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.kids.scss` (multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:26:49 and 4/2/2026, 14:14:40):**
    *   This stylesheet defines kid-mode specific focus styles.
    *   **4/2/2026, 12:26:49**: Defines `box-shadow`, `_outline`, `border-color`, and removes `border` and `outline` for `.fixed-focus .inner` in kid mode. Also includes commented-out styles for `&.round`.
    *   **4/2/2026, 12:33:20**: Simplified `.fixed-focus .inner` styles, removing `_outline`, `border: 0px`, and `outline: 0px`.
    *   **4/2/2026, 12:35:24**: Reverted `.fixed-focus .inner` styles to include `_outline`, `border: 0px`, and `outline: 0px`.
    *   **4/2/2026, 12:35:49**: Reverted back to the simplified styles again, removing `_outline`, `border: 0px`, and `outline: 0px`.
    *   **4/2/2026, 12:37:39**: Added `outline: 3px solid #be2649;` to `.fixed-focus .inner`. The commented `&.round` block was uncommented and updated with specific `width`, `height`, `box-shadow`, and `border` properties.
    *   **4/2/2026, 12:37:59**: Changed the `outline` color for `.fixed-focus .inner` to `$base-color-3cat-kid-light-purple` and set `outline: 0px;` for `&.round .inner`.
    *   **4/2/2026, 12:42:40**: The commented `&.round` block from 12:37:39 was uncommented. The `outline` for `&.round .inner` was removed.
    *   **4/2/2026, 12:43:30**: Reverted to a previous state for `fixed-focus .inner` (including `_outline`, no explicit `outline`). The `&.round` block was commented out.
    *   **4/2/2026, 12:44:18**: `fixed-focus .inner` now explicitly sets `outline: 3px solid $base-color-3cat-kid-light-purple;` and `&.round .inner` sets `outline: 0px;`.
    *   **4/2/2026, 14:02:51**: Simplified `.fixed-focus .inner` to just include `box-shadow`, `border-color`, and `outline`.
    *   **4/2/2026, 14:06:31**: No functional code changes from the previous timestamp.
    *   **4/2/2026, 14:14:22 & 4/2/2026, 14:14:40**: Added `&.round, &.big-round` selector to set `outline: 0px;` for their `.inner` elements, and corrected the `big-round` class name to `bigRound` in the latter. This reflects the introduction of a new "big round" focus shape and consistent styling.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\index.jsx` (multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:27:53 and 4/2/2026, 13:42:39):**

    *   This utility file provides functions for image handling, including `getImgProxyUrl`, `getBestImage`, `getBestImageV2`, `getLogoImage`, `getImageByFormat`, and `generateImageData`.
    *   **5/2/2026, 9:38:25**: `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` includes `"round", "round"`. `getBestImageV2` includes `"square-round"` in `notAllowedFomats` when `desiredAspect` is `LANDSCAPE`.
    *   **5/2/2026, 9:38:51**: `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` still includes `round` twice. `getBestImageV2` adds `"square-round"` to `notAllowedFomats` for `LANDSCAPE`.
    *   **5/2/2026, 9:40:12**: No functional code changes from the previous timestamp.
    *   **5/2/2026, 9:40:33**: Corrected `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` to remove the duplicate "round", now containing `"round", "square-round"`.
    *   **5/2/2026, 9:44:04**: Removed `"square-round"` from `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS`. In `getBestImageV2`, added `"big-round"` to `notAllowedFomats` when `desiredAspect` is `LANDSCAPE`. This indicates a change in how `big-round` images are handled for specific aspect ratios.
    *   **5/2/2026, 9:46:50 & 5/2/2026, 9:46:57**: `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` includes `square-round`. `getBestImageV2` still includes `square-round` and `big-round` in `notAllowedFomats` for `LANDSCAPE`. No other functional changes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Kid Mode / User Type Specific Logic:** A significant recurring theme is the introduction and refinement of "kid mode" or `UserType.KID` specific behaviors and styles. This is evident in:
    *   `SideMenu`: Menu data generation (`settingsData.child_menu`), user menu options.
    *   `RoundItem`: `isKidsProfile` prop influencing image format lookup and `textAlign`.
    *   `UsersScreen`: `onSelectKids` functionality.
    *   `Page`: Filtering `user_row` for kid users, selecting `child_home_id`.
    *   Styling: `styles.kids.scss` files (`roundItem`, `fixedFocus`, `App`) dedicated to kid-specific visual adjustments (colors, focus effects, border properties). This implies a distinct user experience for children within the application.
2.  **Focus and Navigation Management:** There are frequent updates related to how focus is managed in the UI, especially for Smart TV remote control navigation.
    *   `App.jsx`: Global focus actions (`triggerFocusAction`, `triggerBlurAction`).
    *   `generic.js`: Keyboard navigation `onKeyDownHandler`, `KeyMemory` for combinations, `nav.actionFunction`.
    *   `SideMenu`: `nav.focusById`, `nav.storedFocus`, `nav.fixedFocus.isNavigating` for menu interaction.
    *   `RoundItem`, `GenericRow`, `ExternalContentModal`: `registerFocusAction`, `unregisterFocusAction`, `nav.focusById` on `onMouseOver` for individual items.
    *   `fixedFocus.scss` and `fixedFocus.kids.scss`: Detailed styling for various focus shapes (`keyframe`, `round`, `bigRound`, `poster`, `square`, `landscape-mini`) and their appearance in kid mode.
3.  **Platform-Specific Adaptations (WebOS, Tizen, HbbTV):** The code includes explicit checks and different logic paths based on `window.AppGlobal.platform`.
    *   `app.js` (gateway): Determines connection manager and remote URL based on WebOS SDK version.
    *   `generic.js`: Handles platform-specific key codes for player actions on WebOS and Tizen.
    *   `Page`: Filters external content rows for HbbTV, `isLiveSupported` and `isShakaPlayerSupported` checks.
    *   `App.jsx`: Conditional rendering for `BroadcastProvider` on HbbTV, `PlatformRedirect` logic.
    *   `config.xml` (Tizen): Explicit Tizen-specific configurations, privileges, and metadata.
4.  **Modal and Dialog Management:** There's a clear pattern of controlling modals for user interactions and app exit.
    *   `App.jsx`: `exitModal` state, `openExitAppModal`, `closeExitAppModal`, `handleCancel`, `handleOk` functions manage app exit and logout modals.
    *   `UsersScreen`: Uses `PageHead` with `onBackClick` tied to `openExitAppModal`.
    *   `goBackHistory.js`: Incorporates `window.isUserModalVisible` and new `window.__foceEntry` checks to control back navigation behavior when modals or specific entry points are active.
5.  **Image Handling and Optimization:** The `img.js` file shows a dedicated effort to retrieve and display images optimally.
    *   Uses `IMGPROXY_PRESETS` for responsive image loading.
    *   `getImgProxyUrl` constructs URLs for image proxy.
    *   `removeItemsFromArray` filters out unwanted image formats.
    *   `getBestImage` and `getBestImageV2` select the most appropriate image based on dimensions, aspect ratio, and priority (text/no-text).
    *   `getLogoImage` and `getImageByFormat` retrieve specific image formats.
    *   Constant refinement of `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` and aspect ratio filtering in `getBestImageV2`.
6.  **Continuous UI/UX Refinement:** Many changes involve minor but frequent adjustments to styling, layout, and how information is presented, suggesting an ongoing process of polishing the user interface and experience. This is especially visible in the `styles.scss` files and the `RoundItem` component's evolution.

## 11:22:07
The code changes primarily focus on the 3cat_smarttv project, with a single initial change in a gateway project. The majority of modifications revolve around UI/UX enhancements, navigation, user management, and platform-specific adjustments for Smart TV environments (WebOS, Tizen, HbbTV).

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\3cat_pro\gateway\js\app.js (2/2/2026, 14:16:27):** This file, from the `gateway` project, contains JavaScript for initializing a WebOS application. It determines the `connectionmanager` service based on the SDK version and redirects the user to `REMOTE` URL (`https://smartv-dev.3cat.website/` or `https://smartv-pro.3cat.website/`) if an internet connection is available. If not, it displays an alert and subscribes to network status changes to redirect once a connection is established. It also handles `VK_BACK` key presses for platform navigation.

*   **c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx (2/2/2026, 16:31:34):** This React component handles the display of media information (tags, title, description, duration, age rating, season/episode counts, expiration info) for various content types (live, upcoming events, external content).
    *   **Key changes:** Added `formatFullDateWithLabelUTC` and `formatCatalanDayMonthWithLabelUTC` imports. Introduced `useExternalEmission` hook. Implemented `EpisodeCount` and `SeasonsCount` components with logic for displaying chapter/season counts, including a `CCMA-1685` reference for `episode_count` limits. Commented out `Publication` component, with a `JIRA CCMA-2104` note indicating removal of "A partir del" functionality. Refined logic for displaying titles based on content type (live, audio, thematic, link). Added filtering for empty `rating_tags`. Introduced `showExpiration_v2` and simplified `dotSeparatedItems`. Added conditional rendering for external content (live external tag, white tag, platform logo). Expanded logic for `shouldShowProgramTitle` and `shouldShowEpisodeTitle`.

*   **c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\mediaTitle\styles.scss (2/2/2026, 16:33:36):** Styles for the media title component.
    *   **Key changes:** Defined `mediaTitle` styles with font properties, line-clamping for multi-line text, and max-width. Added specific styles for `&.title_program`, `&.live`, `&.isLive_or_upcoming_event`, `&.stream`, and `&.menu_detail` to adjust font weight and size. Also added `&.external` for external content titles.

*   **c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\portraitItem\styles.scss (2/2/2026, 16:39:57):** Styles for portrait items in rows.
    *   **Key changes:** Added styles for `focused` state (box-shadow, border, outline). Defined `tag` styles for displaying content tags, including positioning, font, and box-shadow. Added `platform-logo` styles for displaying external platform logos at the bottom of the item, including nested `externalLogo` and `externalIcon` styles. Also updated `&:hover` and `.V-SCROLLABLE:not(.fixed) &.focused` styles for consistency.

*   **c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\keyboard\styles.scss (2/2/2026, 16:56:08 & 2/2/2026, 17:09:25):** Styles for a virtual keyboard.
    *   **Key changes:** Initial definition of `.keyboard` and `.keyboard-row` layout. Defined `.keyboard-key` styles for buttons, including background, color, font, size, and border-radius. Added specific styles for different key sizes (`.SMALL`, `.MEDIUM`, `.LARGE`) and icons (`.icon-BACKSPACE`, `.icon-SPACE_BAR`, `.icon-RETURN`). Defined `.focused` state with distinct box-shadow and border for visual feedback. The second timestamp adds a `:hover` state identical to the `.focused` state for mouse interaction.

*   **c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js (2/2/2026, 17:08:44 & 5/2/2026, 13:32:40):** Contains generic keyboard navigation logic for Smart TVs.
    *   **Key changes:** Implemented `window.AppGlobal.KeyMemory` to track last three key presses for combination actions (e.g., enabling/disabling ads). Defined `window.AppGlobal.keyCombinations` for these key sequence actions. `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartTV` function handles global keydown events, preventing default actions, throttling events, and dispatching custom navigation events. It includes a large `switch` statement for common Smart TV key codes (Up, Down, Left, Right, Enter, Back, Escape, Backspace) and platform-specific codes for WebOS and Tizen (Play, Pause, Stop, Rewind, FastForward). The update on `5/2` comments out the `e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation();` lines at the beginning of `onKeyDownHandler` and also comments out `dispatchRewindEvent()` and `dispatchFastForwardEvent()` calls for WebOS, Tizen, and other platforms, suggesting a change in how media playback controls are handled or delegated. It also comments out a throttling line.

*   **c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\index.jsx (2/2/2026, 17:36:09 & 2/2/2026, 17:36:22):** React component for the application's side menu.
    *   **Key changes:** Extensively uses `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, and `useCallback` hooks. Manages L1 and L2 menu states (open/close, navigation). Dynamically generates menu data based on user type (kid/adult) and settings. Includes a `refreshSelectedOption` function to highlight the current route in the menu. Implemented functions for opening/closing menu levels, exiting the menu, and handling user-related actions (change user, exit app). The `attachSearchAtTheBeginning` function adds a search option to the L1 menu. Navigation functions (`navigateTo`) handle routing and state management. The second timestamp (minor) primarily adds `window.__isEntry = isMenuVisible;` within a `useEffect` hook.

*   **c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\onboarding\usersScreen\index.jsx (Multiple timestamps between 2/2/2026, 17:45:11 and 2/2/2026, 18:14:59):** React component for user selection/onboarding screen.
    *   **Key changes:** Manages loading state, displays a list of users, and provides options for "Kids" (Super3) and "Add User." Handles user selection (`onSelectUser`, `onSelectKids`, `onSelectAddUser`) and navigates to appropriate routes. Several small, iterative changes related to `window.__isEntry` and `window.__foceEntry` variables for controlling back navigation behavior (commenting out `location.state?.isEntry`, hardcoding `window.__isEntry = true`, and introducing `window.__foceEntry` with a cleanup effect).

*   **c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\utils\goBackHistory.js (2/2/2026, 18:15:16):** Utility function for handling back navigation.
    *   **Key changes:** Added `window.__isEntry` and `window.__foceEntry` to the conditions that trigger `callBackFunc()` (likely an exit app modal). This indicates an attempt to better control application exit points from specific entry screens.

*   **c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx (Multiple timestamps between 2/2/2026, 18:50:50 and 2/2/2026, 19:14:36):** Main application component (React).
    *   **Key changes:** Configures React Router routes for various application views (onboarding, collections, player, detail pages, search, configuration). Integrates numerous context providers (Auth, Broadcast, History, Sitecatalyst, Capabilities, Options, Didomi, ParentalControl, Settings, Texts, Highlight, Virtualization). Initializes platform and keyboard. Includes `BuildInfo` component for displaying debug information (environment, user agent, version, platform, OS, resolution, player/ads status). Manages application-level modals (ExitAppModal, ExtraAppModals). Introduced `PlatformRedirect` for HbbTV vs. other platforms. Multiple minor changes related to `openExitAppModal` function calls, specifically toggling `window.isUserModalVisible` and `nav.storedFocus` management. One change (`2/2/2026, 18:52:39`) explicitly calls `window.AppMenu.manageFocused?.()` within `openExitAppModal`.

*   **c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\tizen\3cat_pro\config.xml (3/2/2026, 13:24:24 & 5/2/2026, 10:47:12 & 5/2/2026, 11:41:17):** Tizen application configuration file.
    *   **Key changes:** Modified the `id` and `package` attributes of the `<tizen:application>` tag, likely for different environments or branding (from `PzkKxRdFT6.TV3.qa` to `PzkKxRdFT6qa.TV3` and the overall widget id). The timestamp `5/2/2026, 11:41:17` shows no functional change compared to the previous Tizen XML entry.

*   **c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 11:36:24 and 4/2/2026, 14:01:29):** React component for displaying round-shaped items in rows.
    *   **Key changes:** Introduced `isKidsProfile` prop to conditionally find `big-round` images for kid profiles (later reverted to `round` for kids and introduced `isBigRound` for specific styling). Refined image selection logic using `useMemo` based on `item.images` and `isKidsProfile`/`isBigRound`. Updated `className` and inline styles for the `img` element to handle `round` vs. `kids-round`/`big-round` types. The `data-nav-fixed-focus-shape` attribute was changed from a fixed `'round'` to `isBigRound ? 'bigRound' : 'round'`.

*   **c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\rowUtils.js (4/2/2026, 12:01:27 & 4/2/2026, 12:01:36):** Utility function for determining row type.
    *   **Key changes:** The second update changes `rowData.format === 'square-mini'` to `rowData.format === 'square_mini'` when determining if a row is 'ROUND'. This is a minor correction in a string literal.

*   **c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:02:26 and 4/2/2026, 12:54:35):** Generic React component for rendering various types of content rows.
    *   **Key changes:** Added `SQUARE_MINI` case to `getRowElement` and `getShowAllElementsFocusShape` functions, indicating support for a new square mini item type. The latest change adds `isKidsProfile && <div className="roundItemTitle">{item.title}</div>` conditional rendering to display a title below round items specifically in kids' mode, which was subsequently removed in a later change in `roundRow/index.jsx`.

*   **c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.kids.scss (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:22:36 and 4/2/2026, 14:12:14):** SCSS styles specific to `roundItem` in "kid-mode."
    *   **Key changes:** Initially defined `background-color` for `.roundElement` in kid mode. Later added a `border` to this element, then removed the border. The final change restores the `background-color` without the explicit border. The file was briefly empty before some of these changes.

*   **c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.kids.scss (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:26:49 and 4/2/2026, 14:14:40):** SCSS styles for fixed focus elements in "kid-mode."
    *   **Key changes:** Iteratively defined and refined styles for the `.fixed-focus .inner` element in `kid-mode`, primarily adjusting `box-shadow`, `border-color`, and `outline` to use kid-friendly purple tones. There were also adjustments for `.round` focus shapes, initially defining its dimensions and border, then removing the outline, re-adding it, and finally making the outline transparent for `&.round, &.bigRound` elements.

*   **c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\index.jsx (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:27:53 and 4/2/2026, 13:42:39):** React component for rendering rows of round items.
    *   **Key changes:** Initially used `isKidsProfile` to control `textAlign` and passed it to `RoundItem`. Later, `isBigRound` prop was introduced to differentiate between standard round items and a new "big round" item type. This `isBigRound` prop now controls `textAlign` and also triggers conditional rendering of `roundItemTitle`. The `className` for the main row div was updated to dynamically apply `biground_row` or `round_row` based on `isBigRound`. The `styles.kids.scss` import was temporarily removed, then re-added, then removed again.

*   **c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\styles.scss (4/2/2026, 12:28:04 & 4/2/2026, 13:40:37):** SCSS styles for round item rows.
    *   **Key changes:** The second update introduced distinct `height` definitions for `.round_row` and `.biground_row` classes. It also grouped common styles for both row types and added styles for `.roundItemTitle`, which is conditionally rendered in `roundRow/index.jsx`.

*   **c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\styles.kids.scss (4/2/2026, 12:30:18):** SCSS styles for round rows in kid mode.
    *   **Key changes:** Commented out a height adjustment.

*   **c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\styles.scss (4/2/2026, 12:48:42):** SCSS styles for generic rows.
    *   **Key changes:** Added `&.rowType_SQUARE_MINI` section with a specific `roundItemTitle` style. Adjusted height calculations for `&.rowType_LANDSCAPE` and `&.rowType_USER_ROW`. Added `&.rowType_LIVE_TV` with specific height for external rows.

*   **c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 13:25:55 and 4/2/2026, 13:34:44):** React component for displaying a "page" (often the home screen or a content category).
    *   **Key changes:** Manages loading, error states, and page data. Includes logic for fetching home data (`getHomeData`) and generic page data (`getPageData`). Features complex logic for refreshing live content and filtering child elements based on platform capabilities (e.g., `isLiveSupported`, `isShakaPlayerSupported`) and user type (`UserType.KID`). It also filters out external content for HbbTV. Integrates numerous hooks and contexts. Includes callbacks for menu navigation and user changes to reset page state and focus.

*   **c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.scss (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 14:02:04 and 4/2/2026, 14:26:32):** SCSS styles for the fixed focus element.
    *   **Key changes:** Introduced `.bigRound` styles, distinct from `.round`, for width, height, border-radius, box-shadow, and border. Notably, the `.bigRound` focus color was set to `$base-color-3cat-kid-light-purple` initially, then to `$base-color-3cat-kid-white` with `!important` flags, indicating specific styling for a "big round" focus in kid-mode or a specific visual requirement. Also updated `.page` context for `.round, &.bigRound` to share `top` and `left` positioning.

*   **c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.kids.scss (4/2/2026, 14:18:09):** SCSS styles for kid mode in the main app.
    *   **Key changes:** Defined a focused state for scrollable elements in kid mode, applying a purple-toned box-shadow, border-color, and outline.

*   **c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\index.jsx (4/2/2026, 15:12:08 & 4/2/2026, 15:15:17 & 4/2/2026, 15:17:01):** React component for an external content modal.
    *   **Key changes:** Displays details of external content with buttons to open external link or continue in the app. Uses `generateImageData` for responsive image display. The first update defined the structure. The second update dynamically added a `partner` class to `popupLeft` based on `isPartner` prop. The third update adjusted the height used for `generateImageData` based on `isPartner`, using `428` for partners and `544` otherwise, indicating different image aspect ratios for partner content within the modal.

*   **c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss (4/2/2026, 15:15:02):** SCSS styles for the external content modal.
    *   **Key changes:** Defined styling for `externalModalOverlay`, `externalPopup`, `popupLeft`, `popupRight`, `promoTextRow`, `platformTextRow`, and `popupButtons`. Specifically, `.popupLeft.partner` was introduced to set a different height for partner content.

*   **c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\libs\img.js (Multiple timestamps between 5/2/2026, 9:38:25 and 5/2/2026, 9:46:57):** Utility functions for image handling and optimization.
    *   **Key changes:** Consistently updated `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` array across multiple commits. Initially, `round` was duplicated. Later, `square-round` and `big-round` were added to the `notAllowedFomats` for `getBestImageV2`, indicating that these specific formats should not be considered when `getBestImageV2` is selecting a best image for a given aspect ratio. This suggests a more explicit control over which image formats are suitable for `getBestImageV2` to return based on desired aspect.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Kid Mode / User Type Differentiation:** A significant recurring pattern is the introduction and refinement of "kid-mode" specific logic and styling.
    *   `SideMenu`: Menu data generated based on `activeUser?.type === UserType.KID`.
    *   `RoundItem`: Conditional rendering and image format selection (`isKidsProfile`, `isBigRound`).
    *   `GenericRow`: Conditional rendering of `roundItemTitle` for `isKidsProfile`.
    *   `Page`: Home ID selection based on `activeUser?.type === UserType.KID`. User rows are filtered out for kid users.
    *   SCSS files (`styles.kids.scss`, `fixedFocus.scss`, `App.kids.scss`): Extensive use of `.kid-mode` parent selector to apply distinct visual styles (colors, box-shadows, borders) for focused elements, round items, and overall application appearance when in kid mode. This indicates a strong focus on creating a separate, branded experience for children.

2.  **Smart TV Platform Specifics:** The code base addresses multiple Smart TV platforms.
    *   `gateway/js/app.js`: Logic to detect `sdkVersion` for WebOS and adjust `connectionmanager` service and `REMOTE` URL accordingly.
    *   `platform/generic.js`: Keyboard event handling includes common key codes and specific `switch` cases for `webos` and `tizen` platforms. Filters out external content for `hbbtv` in `Page` component.
    *   `config.xml` (Tizen): Platform-specific configuration for Tizen apps (privileges, metadata, screen orientation).

3.  **Focus Management and Navigation (Smart TV Interaction):**
    *   The use of `nav.focusById()`, `nav.move.up/down/left/right()`, `registerFocusAction`, `unregisterFocusAction`, `data-group`, `data-group-restore-last-focused`, `data-nav-fixed-focus-shape`, `data-block-focus-up/down/left/right`, `data-on-lost-left-action`, and `dataOnReceiveFocusAction` attributes across many React components (`RoundItem`, `GenericRow`, `SideMenu`, `ExternalContentModal`) indicates a custom, highly controlled spatial navigation system typical of Smart TV applications.
    *   The `fixedFocus` styles (`fixedFocus.scss`, `fixedFocus.kids.scss`) further confirm this, defining distinct visual feedback for focused elements based on their shape (keyframe, round, bigRound, poster, square, landscape-mini).

4.  **Modular Component Design:** The `3cat_smarttv` project largely uses a component-based architecture (e.g., `mediaInfo`, `items`, `rows`, `modals`, `views`), common in React applications.

5.  **Image Handling and Optimization:** The `libs/img.js` file and its repeated modifications highlight a continuous effort to optimize image loading and selection based on desired dimensions, formats, and aspect ratios, using an `IMGPROXY_URL` and predefined presets. The `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` array is frequently updated to exclude certain image formats from generic selection functions, indicating a need for fine-grained control over image display.

6.  **Modal Management:** Modals (ExitAppModal, ExternalContentModal, UserModal) are centrally managed, often interacting with global `window.AppGlobal.Actions` and `nav.storedFocus` for proper display and focus restoration.

7.  **Development/Debugging Aids:** The `App.jsx` includes `InitDevConsole`, `BuildInfo`, `DebugModalsLauncher`, `DebugConfigPane`, and `DebugSessionSettingsPane`, suggesting a robust debugging and configuration system.

8.  **Consistency in Timestamp:** All changes are dated 2/2/2026, 3/2/2026, 4/2/2026, or 5/2/2026, implying a concentrated period of development or a single major release cycle.
