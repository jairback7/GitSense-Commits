# Activity Summary for 8/2/2026

## 3:20:42
The code changes primarily focus on a SmartTV application, with significant updates across UI components, styling, platform-specific integrations, and overall application flow.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\3cat_pro\gateway\js\app.js` (2/2/2026, 14:16:27):** The gateway application logic was updated to dynamically set the `REMOTE` content URL and `connectionmanager` service endpoint based on the WebOS `sdkVersion`. Specifically, SDK versions less than 300 use `PALM_MANAGER`, and versions less than 350 direct to `'https://smartv-pro.3cat.website/'`. It also includes robust network status checking, displaying an alert if no internet is available and redirecting to the remote URL upon successful connection. A keydown listener for the back button (`VK_BACK`) was added for WebOS platform navigation.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx` (2/2/2026, 16:31:34):** This media information component underwent substantial changes to handle diverse content types. New `EpisodeCount` and `SeasonsCount` components were introduced. A `Publication` feature was commented out (JIRA CCMA-2104). The `showExpiration` function was added to display content availability end dates, considering a three-month lookahead. Logic for determining `logoImage`, `channelLogo`, `duration`, `title`, and `description` was enhanced to prioritize `default_episode` and accommodate live streams, audio, and linked content. Conditional rendering for program and episode titles was refined, and support for external content (displaying platform logos and tags) was integrated.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\mediaTitle\styles.scss` (2/2/2026, 16:33:36):** Minor styling adjustments were made to `mediaTitle` subclasses, modifying `font-weight` and `font-size` for `.title_program`, `.live`, `.stream`, `.isLive_or_upcoming_event`, and `.menu_detail` (which received a bolder weight), and `.external`.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\portraitItem\styles.scss` (2/2/2026, 16:39:57):** Styles were added to incorporate `.platform-logo`, `.externalLogo`, and `.externalIcon` within portrait items, indicating visual support for external content platforms. Focus and hover styles were also refined for better user feedback.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\keyboard\styles.scss` (2/2/2026, 16:56:08 & 17:09:25):** New SCSS was added to define the visual appearance of an on-screen keyboard, including general key styles, size variations (SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE), and icon-based keys (BACKSPACE, SPACE_BAR, RETURN). A `:hover` state was also added to keys, mirroring the focused appearance.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (2/2/2026, 17:08:44) & `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (5/2/2026, 13:32:40):** This file received substantial updates to its keyboard navigation. A `KeyMemory` object was introduced to track key combinations for specific actions like enabling/disabling player ads. The `onKeyDownHandler` was expanded with a throttle (`THROTTLE_MS`) to prevent rapid input processing, and now explicitly prevents default event behavior. Platform-specific key codes for WebOS and Tizen (Play, Pause, Stop, Rewind, FastForward) were integrated, although the specific `dispatchRewindEvent()` and `dispatchFastForwardEvent()` calls were later commented out.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\index.jsx` (2/2/2026, 17:36:09 & 17:36:22):** The `SideMenu` component was developed to manage a two-level menu structure, handling state for selected options (`selL1`, `selL2`) and menu visibility. It includes logic to dynamically generate menu data based on user type (e.g., kid profile), attach a "Search" option, and refresh the selected menu item based on the current URL. Functions for opening, closing, and managing focus within the menu were defined. Minor changes involved adding `window.__isEntry = isMenuVisible;` to a `useEffect` hook.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\onboarding\usersScreen\index.jsx` (2/2/2026, 17:45:11 -> 18:14:59):** This component for selecting users iterated through multiple minor changes. It displays logged-in users, a "Super3" kids profile option, and an "Add User" option, with callbacks for selection. The primary area of change involved the `window.__isEntry` and `window.__foceEntry` flags. Initially setting `__isEntry` from `location.state`, it then directly assigned `true`, commented out `location` usage, and finally introduced a `useEffect` to manage `window.__foceEntry` on mount/unmount for controlled entry-point behavior.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\utils\goBackHistory.js` (2/2/2026, 18:15:16):** The `goBackHistory` utility was modified to check for `window.__isEntry` or `window.__foceEntry` flags, allowing it to execute a callback (e.g., open an exit app modal) instead of performing a `history.go(-1)` navigation, aligning with the `usersScreen` changes.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (2/2/2026, 18:50:50 -> 19:14:36):** The main application file received iterative adjustments related to modal and menu interaction. It defines the application's routing structure and context providers. Updates involved repeatedly commenting out and re-enabling lines for showing the exit modal (`setExitModal(ModalTypes.EXIT)`) and managing menu focus (`AppMenu.manageFocused?.()`) within the `openExitAppModal` function, indicating a period of active debugging and fine-tuning of application exit behavior.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\tizen\3cat_pro\config.xml` (3/2/2026, 13:24:24 -> 5/2/2026, 11:41:17):** The Tizen application configuration file had its `id` attributes for both `widget` and `tizen:application` modified. Specifically, `http://tizen.tv3.ccma.cat.qa` became `http://tizen.qa.ccma.cat`, and the application ID was adjusted from `PzkKxRdFT6.TV3.qa` to `PzkKxRdFT6qa.TV3`. This suggests an update to application identifiers, likely for a QA environment.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx` (4/2/2026, 11:36:24 -> 14:01:29):** This component, responsible for rendering round items, underwent extensive refactoring. It initially toggled logic for `isKidsProfile` and specific image formats (like `big-round`), eventually consolidating to use an `isBigRound` prop. This prop now dictates the image format search (`big-round` vs. `round`) and dynamically sets the `data-nav-fixed-focus-shape` attribute to `bigRound` or `round`.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.scss` (4/2/2026, 13:53:09):** New styles were added for `.roundElement` and a new `.biground_row` class, defining specific widths, heights, margins, and borders to visually differentiate between standard and "big round" items.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.kids.scss` (4/2/2026, 12:22:36 -> 14:12:14):** This file saw frequent, small changes to `background-color` and `border` properties for `.roundElement` within `kid-mode`, indicating ongoing design iterations for the kids' UI. The border property was repeatedly added and removed.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.kids.scss` (4/2/2026, 12:26:49 -> 14:14:40):** Numerous adjustments were made to the focus styles for elements in `kid-mode`. This included changes to `box-shadow`, `border-color`, and `outline` for general focused elements, and specific modifications for `.round` and `.bigRound` focus shapes, often involving toggling between different properties or color values.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\index.jsx` (4/2/2026, 12:27:53 -> 13:42:39):** This component, which renders rows of `RoundItem`s, was updated to pass the `isBigRound` prop (replacing previous `isKidsProfile` prop), and conditionally apply the `biground_row` class to its container. It also had `styles.kids.scss` imported and removed multiple times.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\styles.scss` (4/2/2026, 12:28:04 & 13:40:37):** This SCSS file was updated to define separate heights for `.round_row` and the newly introduced `.biground_row`, as well as general styles for `.roundItemTitle`.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\styles.kids.scss` (4/2/2026, 12:30:18):** A commented-out height adjustment for `.round_row` in `kid-mode` was present.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (4/2/2026, 12:02:26 -> 12:54:35):** The `GenericRow` component was extended to handle `SQUARE_MINI` as a distinct row type, mapping it to `SquareItem`. It also gained more refined logic for `generateShowAllElements` and `isExternalRow`. A potentially erroneous line was added for conditional `roundItemTitle` rendering outside its scope.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\styles.scss` (4/2/2026, 12:48:42):** Styles for various `rowType_` classes were expanded, including the introduction of `.roundItemTitle` within `.rowType_SQUARE_MINI` and comprehensive styling for `.item-show-all` elements.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (4/2/2026, 13:25:55 -> 13:34:44):** The `Page` component, responsible for fetching and displaying content, remained largely stable during this period, with primarily non-functional save operations. Its core logic includes real-time updates for live content (`refreshLives`), filtering children based on user type and platform capabilities, and robust error handling.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.scss` (4/2/2026, 14:02:04 -> 14:26:32):** The generic fixed focus styling received iterative updates, particularly in defining the `bigRound` focus shape. This included specifying its dimensions (275px x 275px), and repeatedly adjusting its `box-shadow` and `border` colors, eventually settling on a "kid-white" color with `!important` flags, along with updates to how `.page` styles apply to both `round` and `bigRound` focus.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.kids.scss` (4/2/2026, 14:18:09):** A new styling rule was added to provide specific `box-shadow`, `border-color`, and `outline` for focused elements within `.kid-mode` using a light purple color.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\index.jsx` (4/2/2026, 15:12:08 -> 15:17:01):** The `ExternalContentModal` component was enhanced to handle "partner" specific content. It now conditionally applies a `partner` class to its `popupLeft` section and dynamically adjusts the image height based on the `isPartner` prop.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss` (4/2/2026, 15:15:02):** New SCSS was added to define the layout and appearance of the external content modal, including styles for text rows, buttons, and a specific `.partner` style for the `popupLeft` element.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\libs\img.js` (5/2/2026, 9:38:25 -> 9:46:57):** The image utility library saw modifications to its `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` list, specifically adding `square-round` and `big-round` to ensure `getBestImageV2` correctly filters images based on desired aspect ratio. A duplicate `round` entry was also removed from `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **SmartTV Specifics:** A strong recurring theme is the adaptation and optimization for SmartTV platforms, including specialized keyboard navigation (WebOS, Tizen), platform-specific connection managers, and handling of various media types (live streams).
*   **UI/UX Refinement & Debugging:** Many files show rapid, iterative changes (especially `usersScreen/index.jsx`, `App.jsx`, `roundItem/index.jsx`, and associated `.scss` files) within short timeframes. This suggests an active phase of debugging, A/B testing, and fine-tuning of UI elements, navigation, and modal interactions. Common patterns include commenting/uncommenting code and slight value adjustments.
*   **Kid Mode / User Profiles:** There is a consistent emphasis on "kid-mode" or "Super3" profiles, evidenced by conditional logic (`isKidsProfile`, `activeUser?.type === UserType.KID`) and dedicated SCSS files (`.kids.scss`) for distinct styling of elements like round items and focus indicators.
*   **Focus Management:** Implementing and refining focus management for keyboard/remote navigation is critical for SmartTV apps, and is evident through `registerFocusAction`, `data-block-focus-*` attributes, and dedicated `fixedFocus` components and styles.
*   **Component-Based Development:** The widespread use of React hooks (`useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useState`, `useCallback`) highlights a component-driven architecture for the application.
*   **Image Handling:** Complex image selection and processing logic (`img.js`) is present, including image proxy usage and filtering based on format, aspect ratio, and source.

## 8:22:12
The provided logs show a series of code changes across a Smart TV application, primarily focusing on UI components, navigation, and platform-specific functionalities.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\3cat_pro\gateway\js\app.js` (Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 14:16:27)**
    *   This file defines the `init` function for a WebOS application gateway.
    *   It dynamically determines the `connectionmanager` service URL based on the `sdkVersion` (either `com.webos.service.connectionmanager` for SDK versions 3.00+ or `com.palm.connectionmanager` for older versions).
    *   The `REMOTE` URL for content delivery is also conditionally set: `https://smartv-dev.3cat.website/` for SDK < 3.50, and `https://smartv-pro.3cat.website/` for SDK >= 3.50.
    *   It checks for internet connection and redirects the user to the `REMOTE` URL if available. If not, it displays an alert and sets up a `keydown` listener for the `VK_BACK` button to exit the platform.
    *   It also subscribes to connection status changes to redirect once connectivity is restored.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx` (Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 16:31:34)**
    *   This React component (`InfoGroup`) handles the display of media information such as title, description, tags, age rating, and duration.
    *   Significant updates include:
        *   Introduction of `EpisodeCount` and `SeasonsCount` components for displaying episode/season numbers, with `EpisodeCount` having a `LIVE_REFRESH_INTERVAL` check (`CCMA-1685`).
        *   Commented out `Publication` component, indicating removal of "A partir del" functionality (`JIRA CCMA-2104`).
        *   Refinements to `showExpiration` logic, adding a prefix "Disponible fins a l'" or "Disponible fins al" based on the day.
        *   Enhanced logic for determining `title` and `description` from `item`, `default_episode`, and `stream` properties, including specific handling for live content, audio, and thematic channels.
        *   Improved `shouldShowProgramTitle` and `shouldShowEpisodeTitle` memoized logic for conditional rendering.
        *   Filtering of empty `rating_tags`.
        *   Updates to `dotSeparatedItems` to reflect the removal of `Publication`.
        *   New logic for `is_external` content, including `MediaTag` for live/white tags and displaying external platform logos.
        *   Extensive conditional rendering based on item properties (`isLive`, `isUpcomingEvent`, `is_licensed`, `tag_program`, `collection`).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\mediaTitle\styles.scss` (Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 16:33:36)**
    *   Styling for the `mediaTitle` component.
    *   Specific styles added for `.title_program`, `.live`, `.isLive_or_upcoming_event`, and `.stream` to adjust `font-weight` and `font-size` (38px).
    *   A new `.external` class was added, setting `font-size` to 56px.
    *   `.menu_detail` received a `font-weight: 700` and `font-size: 38px`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\portraitItem\styles.scss` (Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 16:39:57)**
    *   Styling for `.portraitItem`.
    *   Added styles for `:hover` and `.V-SCROLLABLE:not(.fixed) &.focused` to apply a red box-shadow, border-color, and outline, indicating focus/hover state.
    *   Introduced new styling for `.platform-logo` and its children (`.externalLogo`, `.externalIcon`) to display external platform information at the bottom of the item.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\keyboard\styles.scss` (Multiple timestamps: 2/2/2026, 16:56:08 and 2/2/2026, 17:09:25)**
    *   These changes involve slight adjustments to keyboard key styles. The second entry (17:09:25) adds a `:hover` state for `.keyboard-key` to match the `.focused` state, providing visual feedback on mouse-over.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (Multiple timestamps: 2/2/2026, 17:08:44 and 5/2/2026, 13:32:40)**
    *   This file manages generic keyboard navigation and player controls across Smart TV platforms.
    *   The first change (17:08:44) introduces a `THROTTLE_MS` (200ms) to prevent rapid key events, adds player-specific keys to `PLAYER_KEYS` set, and handles navigation events (`customNavigation`) for UP/DOWN keys when a user modal is not visible. It also includes platform-specific key handling for WebOS and Tizen.
    *   The later change (5/2/2026, 13:32:40) comments out the `e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation();` calls in `onKeyDownHandler` and also comments out `dispatchRewindEvent()` and `dispatchFastForwardEvent()` calls for platform-specific player controls, indicating a potential change in how these events are handled or a temporary disablement. The throttling logic (`if (now - lastTs < THROTTLE_MS) return;`) is also commented out.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps: 2/2/2026, 17:36:09 and 2/2/2026, 17:36:22)**
    *   Both entries are virtually identical, indicating a minor save or insignificant change.
    *   This React component (`SideMenu`) manages the application's main navigation menu.
    *   It initializes `window.AppMenu.vars` for menu state.
    *   Handles menu data generation based on user type (kid or adult).
    *   Includes logic for opening/closing menu levels, refreshing selected options based on the current path, and navigating to different routes.
    *   Introduces an `attachSearchAtTheBeginning` function to prepend a 'Search' option to the L1 menu data.
    *   The `manageFocused` function is crucial for navigation focus handling when interacting with the menu.
    *   Functions for changing users (`fnDoChangeUser`) and exiting the app (`fnExitApp`) are defined.
    *   `navigateTo` function handles route changes and updates `window.AppGlobal.Slider.wasSliderRowRendered` and `window.AppGlobal.AllCatalog.filter`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\onboarding\usersScreen\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps between 2/2/2026, 17:45:11 and 2/2/2026, 18:14:59)**
    *   This React component (`UsersScreen`) displays a list of users for selection (including "Super3" for kids and "Add User").
    *   There are several minor changes related to `window.__isEntry`:
        *   Initially, `window.__isEntry` is set based on `location.state?.isEntry || false`.
        *   Then it's set to `true` directly (18:05:33, 18:06:49, 18:10:38).
        *   Finally, it introduces a `window.__foceEntry` ref and `useEffect` to manage its value (18:14:59). This suggests an attempt to force a specific entry behavior, potentially for back button handling.
    *   The `PageHead` component's `onBackClick` is consistently set to `window.AppGlobal.Actions.openExitAppModal`.
    *   The `onSelectUser`, `onSelectKids`, and `onSelectAddUser` callbacks handle user selection and navigation.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\utils\goBackHistory.js` (Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 18:15:16)**
    *   Modified the `goBackHistory` function to check for `window.__isEntry` or `window.__foceEntry` when deciding whether to call `callBackFunc()` (which likely opens the exit app modal) or navigate back using `window.history.go(-1)`.
    *   It also includes specific logic for when a media player is active to hide its sub-menu or go back.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (Multiple timestamps between 2/2/2026, 18:50:50 and 2/2/2026, 19:14:36)**
    *   This is the main application file, defining routing and context providers.
    *   Repeated changes across these timestamps suggest frequent saves or minor reverts/tweaks related to the `openExitAppModal` function.
    *   Specifically, `openExitAppModal`'s logic for setting `window.isUserModalVisible` and `nav.storedFocus`, and `setExitModal(ModalTypes.EXIT)` is commented out and re-enabled a few times.
    *   The call to `window.AppMenu.manageFocused?.()` within `openExitAppModal` is present in some versions and removed in others (e.g., present at 18:52:39, removed at 18:54:07). This indicates a fluctuating approach to managing focus when an exit modal is opened.
    *   The core structure (BrowserRouter, Routes, Context Providers) remains consistent.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\tizen\3cat_pro\config.xml` (Multiple timestamps: 3/2/2026, 13:24:24, 5/2/2026, 10:47:12, and 5/2/2026, 11:41:17)**
    *   The `id` attribute of the `<widget>` element changed from `http://tizen.tv3.ccma.cat.qa` to `http://tizen.qa.ccma.cat` between 3/2 and 5/2.
    *   The `id` attribute of the `<tizen:application>` element changed from `PzkKxRdFT6.TV3.qa` to `PzkKxRdFT6qa.TV3` between 3/2 and 5/2.
    *   These changes likely reflect a shift in the application's identifier or domain within the Tizen build configuration, possibly related to a change in the QA environment setup. The content remains identical for the other elements across these changes.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 11:36:24 and 4/2/2026, 14:01:29)**
    *   Extensive modifications relate to handling round items, especially for "Kid Mode" and "Big Round" items.
    *   Initial changes introduced conditional image lookup for `isKidsProfile` to find `round` images, then changed to `big-round` for kid mode (12:08:06).
    *   The `isKidsProfile` check was removed from the `useMemo` for `image` and `type` determination (12:21:39), implying that the `roundItem` itself might no longer directly detect kid mode.
    *   Later changes (13:44:59 onwards) introduced an `isBigRound` prop, and the logic was updated to use `big-round` format images when `isBigRound` is true. The `className` and `data-nav-fixed-focus-shape` are also adjusted accordingly to handle `big-round` styling and focus.
    *   The `isKidsProfile` prop was removed from `RoundItem` (12:56:53).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.scss` (Timestamp: 4/2/2026, 13:53:09)**
    *   Introduced a new `.biground_row` style block for `.roundElement` to adjust width and height for larger round items. The `border: 5px solid white !important;` was changed to `border: none !important;` when `round-image` is present.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.kids.scss` (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:22:36 and 4/2/2026, 13:54:47)**
    *   Styling for `.roundElement` within `.kid-mode`.
    *   Initially set `background-color` to `$base-color-3cat-kid-bright-purple`.
    *   Then added a `border: 5px solid $base-color-3cat-kid-bright-purple !important;`.
    *   The border was later removed, then re-added, indicating iterative styling adjustments for kid mode.
    *   The final change (13:54:47) re-introduces the background color and border for `.roundElement` in kid mode.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.kids.scss` (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:26:49 and 4/2/2026, 14:14:40)**
    *   This file defines focus styles for "Kid Mode".
    *   There are numerous changes to the `.inner` box-shadow, border-color, and outline properties, often being added, removed, or tweaked, suggesting fine-tuning of visual focus indicators for kid mode.
    *   Specific styles for `&.round` were added, removed, and re-added.
    *   The final changes (14:14:22, 14:14:40) remove the outline for `&.round` and `&.bigRound` elements within `.kid-mode .fixed-focus .inner`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\rowUtils.js` (Multiple timestamps: 4/2/2026, 12:01:27 and 4/2/2026, 12:01:36)**
    *   Minor change: `rowData.format === 'square-mini'` was changed to `rowData.format === 'square_mini'` in the `getRowkind` function. This indicates a naming convention correction or update.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:02:26 and 4/2/2026, 12:54:35)**
    *   This component renders various types of rows in the UI.
    *   Updates include:
        *   Added `SQUARE_MINI` to `getRowElement` and `getShowAllElementsFocusShape` functions, indicating support for this new row item type.
        *   Removed conditional `isKidsProfile` rendering for `roundItemTitle` (12:54:35), suggesting that the `roundItemTitle` is now conditionally rendered directly within `RoundRow`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\styles.scss` (Timestamp: 4/2/2026, 12:48:42)**
    *   Introduced new styling for `&.rowType_SQUARE_MINI`, including specific `width`, `height`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom`, and styling for a `.roundItemTitle`. This is related to the addition of the `SQUARE_MINI` item type.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:27:53 and 4/2/2026, 13:42:39)**
    *   Refactored to handle "Kid Mode" and "Big Round" displays.
    *   Initially `textAlign` in `roundItemWrapper` was conditionally set based on `isKidsProfile` (12:27:53), then removed (12:30:58, 12:56:05, 12:57:05).
    *   The `isKidsProfile` prop was removed from `RoundRow` and `RoundItem` props.
    *   A new `isBigRound` prop was introduced, which is now used to conditionally apply a `biground_row` class to the row container (13:38:35).
    *   The `RoundItemTitle` component is now conditionally rendered directly within `RoundRow` when `isBigRound` is true (13:35:58).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\styles.scss` (Timestamp: 4/2/2026, 13:40:37)**
    *   Introduced `.biground_row` styles to define a different height (`calc(200px + 171px)`) compared to `.round_row` (`calc(200px + 70px)`).
    *   Consolidated common styles for `.round_row` and `.biground_row`.
    *   Added styles for `.roundItemTitle`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 13:25:55 and 4/2/2026, 13:34:44)**
    *   This component (`Page`) handles the display of a content page, including dynamic row rendering and live content updates.
    *   There were two identical commits within a short timeframe (13:25:55 and 13:26:44), implying a save without changes.
    *   The logic for `filterChildren` was updated to specifically filter out `user_row` items when `activeUser?.type === UserType.KID`, ensuring kid users don't see certain rows. This seems to be the main functional change in this file.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 15:12:08 and 4/2/2026, 15:17:01)**
    *   This modal displays details for external content.
    *   Introduced `isPartner` prop, based on `item.collection === 'partner'`, to apply different styles and image sizes for partner content.
    *   The `popupLeft` div now dynamically applies a `partner` class.
    *   The `generateImageData` call now considers `isPartner` when calculating the image height (428px for partner, 544px otherwise).
    *   Conditional rendering of `platformLogoContainer` based on `!isPartner`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss` (Timestamp: 4/2/2026, 15:15:02)**
    *   Added styling for `.popupLeft.partner` to adjust its height to 428px.
    *   Adjusted the `top` position of `.platformLogoContainer` to 544px.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\libs\img.js` (Multiple timestamps between 5/2/2026, 9:38:25 and 5/2/2026, 9:46:57)**
    *   This file provides utility functions for image handling, including `IMGPROXY_PRESETS` and functions to get optimized image URLs and best-fit images.
    *   The `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` array was modified:
        *   Initially, it had `round` listed twice (9:38:25, 9:38:51).
        *   Then `square-round` was added (9:38:51, 9:40:12, 9:40:33).
        *   Then `round` was removed as a duplicate (9:40:33).
        *   `big-round` was added to `notAllowedFomats` within `getBestImageV2` for landscape aspect (9:44:04). This prevents `big-round` images from being considered when searching for landscape or portrait images if they are not explicitly requested.
    *   These changes reflect adjustments to how different image formats are filtered and prioritized when selecting the "best" image for various display contexts.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

1.  **Kid Mode Integration:** There's a strong recurring theme of adapting UI components and behavior for "Kid Mode". This is evident in:
    *   `SideMenu`: Menu data generation (`settingsData.child_menu`).
    *   `UsersScreen`: "Super3" option and `setKidUser`.
    *   `Page`: Filtering `user_row` for kids (`activeUser?.type === UserType.KID`) and dynamic `homeId` selection.
    *   `RoundItem` and `RoundRow`: Specific styling and rendering logic for kid profiles (`isKidsProfile`, `isBigRound`), though `isKidsProfile` prop was later removed from `RoundItem` and `RoundRow`.
    *   SCSS files (`styles.kids.scss`): Dedicated styling files specifically for kid mode, applying different colors (e.g., `$base-color-3cat-kid-bright-purple`, `$base-color-3cat-kid-light-purple`, `$base-color-3cat-kid-white`) and focus aesthetics.
    *   `fixedFocus.scss`: `bigRound` focus styles use kid-mode colors (`$base-color-3cat-kid-white`).

2.  **Focus Management and Navigation (`nav`):** The `nav` object (likely a global navigation library) is heavily used across multiple components:
    *   `app.js`: `$(document).on('keydown', ...)` for `VK_BACK`.
    *   `generic.js`: `nav.move`, `nav.action`, `nav.focusById`, `nav.fixedFocus.isNavigating`, `nav.reset`, `nav.storedFocus`, `nav.getCurrentId`. Key combinations and player controls are also managed here.
    *   `SideMenu`: `nav.focusById`, `nav.storedFocus`, `nav.memory.setGroupLastFocusedID`.
    *   `RoundItem`, `GenericRow`: `registerFocusAction`, `unregisterFocusAction` for custom focus handling and `nav.focusById` on `onMouseOver`.
    *   `App.jsx`: `nav.storedFocus` is managed when opening/closing exit modals.
    *   `Page`: `nav.fixedFocus.isNavigating`, `nav.current.el`, `resetFixedFocus`.

3.  **Platform-Specific Logic:** The application frequently checks `window.AppGlobal.platform` to apply platform-specific behaviors and styling.
    *   `app.js`: Determines `connectionmanager` and `REMOTE` URL based on `sdkVersion` (WebOS/Palm).
    *   `generic.js`: Handles distinct key codes for WebOS and Tizen.
    *   `Page`: Filters children for `hbbtv` (external content) and disables certain rows if live/Shaka player is not supported.
    *   Tizen `config.xml` updates (`id`, `package`) also indicate platform-specific build configurations.

4.  **Content Display and Filtering:**
    *   `InfoGroup`: Complex logic for determining what information to display about media items (title, description, tags, duration, expiration, live status).
    *   `Page`: Dynamically filters rows (`filterChildren`) based on user type (kid), platform capabilities (live/Shaka player support), and external content status.
    *   `img.js`: Extensive image handling, including `IMGPROXY_PRESETS`, `getImgProxyUrl`, `removeItemsFromArray`, `getBestImage`, `getBestImageV2`, `getLogoImage`, `getImageByFormat`, and `generateImageData`. This suggests a sophisticated system for optimizing and serving images based on context (width, height, desired format, external status, text presence, etc.).

5.  **Modal Management:**
    *   `App.jsx`: Manages `ExitAppModal` state and actions (`openExitAppModal`, `closeExitAppModal`, `handleCancel`, `handleOk`).
    *   `Page`: Uses `UserModal` and `ExternalContentModal`.
    *   `goBackHistory.js`: Checks `window.isUserModalVisible` to control back navigation.

6.  **Component Reusability:** Many components (e.g., `GenericRow`, `RoundItem`, `PageHead`, `Spinner`, `Button`, `MediaTag`, `MediaTitle`) are used across different views, implying a modular architecture.

7.  **Timestamp Clustering:** Many changes, especially in UI-related SCSS and React components (`RoundItem`, `RoundRow`, `fixedFocus.kids.scss`, `usersScreen`, `App.jsx`, `img.js`), occur in rapid succession within the same hour or minutes (e.g., 4/2/2026, 12:xx:xx to 14:xx:xx), indicating active development, testing, and fine-tuning of visual and interactive elements. The `App.jsx` and `usersScreen` files show particularly frequent, small changes, suggesting detailed iteration on core application flow and user management.

## 9:21:49
The file `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\FREE FIRE\Free Free Root Go To 2k\PS MODDER YT\app\src\main\jni\Unity\Unity.h`, last modified on `8/2/2026, 9:19:06`, is a C++ header file integral to a project likely focused on modifying or interacting with a Unity-based game, given its location in a "PS MODDER YT" directory.

Key updates and content for this file include:
*   **Android NDK Integration and Logging:** It incorporates `android/log.h` and defines custom logging macros (`LOGE`, `LOGW`, `LOGD`, `LOGI`) using the tag `"PusexPrivate.Xyz"`, indicating a native Android application or library.
*   **3D Math Utilities:** The file provides essential 3D mathematics functions, including `NormalizeAngle` and `NormalizeAngles` for keeping angles within a standard range, `ToEulerRad` for converting quaternions to Euler angles while handling edge cases, and `GetRotationToLocation` to calculate rotations towards a target. These are crucial for handling game object orientations, movement, and aiming.
*   **Unity Mono Runtime Structures:** A significant portion of the file defines template structures such as `monoArray`, `monoList`, `monoDictionary`, and `monoString`. These structures are explicitly designed to mirror the internal data representations used by Unity's Mono runtime, allowing for direct memory access and manipulation of game data.
*   **Game-Specific Context:** The presence of commented-out `Transform` structures with obfuscated names like `{vps^o`, `s^uN~t`, `sqdz[Xb` and descriptive comments like `// Hand`, `// Head`, `// Hip`, `// Toe`, `// LShoulder`, `//RShoulder` strongly suggests a focus on reverse engineering or modding a game's character models and their bone structures, potentially for features like an aimbot or ESP (Extra Sensory Perception).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
The content consistently reveals an effort to interface deeply with a Unity game's internal mechanics. The recurring theme is the implementation of low-level data structures and mathematical functions directly relevant to game engine operations (3D transformations, object lists, dictionaries, strings), coupled with indications of direct memory access and manipulation, characteristic of game modding or hacking tools. The file path itself (e.g., `PS MODDER YT`, `FREE FIRE`) reinforces this interpretation.

## 9:22:09
The code changes reflect a focus on the 3Cat smart TV application, primarily in JavaScript and SCSS files. Key changes occurred between February 2nd and February 5th, 2026.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\3cat_pro\gateway\js\app.js` (2/2/2026, 14:16:27):**
    *   Updated the `init` function to dynamically determine the `connectionmanager` service (WebOS vs. Palm) based on `sdkVersion`.
    *   Introduced logic to change the `REMOTE` URL for SDK versions less than 3.5.0 (switching from `smartv-dev.3cat.website` to `smartv-pro.3cat.website`).
    *   Improved network status handling: if no internet, it shows an alert and registers a `VK_BACK` keydown event to `webOS.platformBack()`. It also subscribes to connection status changes to redirect to `REMOTE + query` when available.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx` (2/2/2026, 16:31:34):**
    *   Introduced `EpisodeCount` and `SeasonsCount` components for displaying episode/season numbers, with a note about JIRA CCMA-1685.
    *   Commented out `Publication` component, noting "JIRA CCMA-2104: Eliminamos funcionalidad 'A partir del'" (Removed 'Available from' functionality).
    *   Added logic to `showExpiration` for displaying expiration dates within three months, with specific Catalan prefixes.
    *   Enhanced `title` and `description` retrieval logic to handle various item types (default episode, live streams, audio, thematic, external content).
    *   Refined `shouldShowProgramTitle` and `shouldShowEpisodeTitle` conditions for displaying titles based on `logoImage`, `is_episode`, `tag_format`, and `collection`.
    *   Added `is_external` and `external_content_data` checks for rendering external platform logos and media tags.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\mediaTitle\styles.scss` (2/2/2026, 16:33:36):**
    *   Defined base styling for `.mediaTitle` (color, font, text shadow, clamping).
    *   Added specific styles for `.title_program`, `.live`, `.isLive_or_upcoming_event`, `.stream`, `.menu_detail`, and `.external` classes, mostly adjusting font-weight and font-size.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\portraitItem\styles.scss` (2/2/2026, 16:39:57):**
    *   Updated styling for `.portraitItem`, including focused states with a red box-shadow/outline.
    *   Added styling for a `.tag` element (white background, black text, rounded corners, absolute positioning).
    *   Introduced `.platform-logo` styles for displaying external platform logos at the bottom left of the item.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\keyboard\styles.scss` (2/2/2026, 16:56:08 & 2/2/2026, 17:09:25):**
    *   Initial creation and minor adjustment of keyboard styles.
    *   Defined layout for `.keyboard` and `.keyboard-row`.
    *   Detailed styling for `.keyboard-key` elements, including various sizes (`.SMALL`, `.MEDIUM`, `.LARGE`), icons (backspace, spacebar, return), and a distinct focused state with a red glow and border.
    *   The second timestamp adds a `:hover` state identical to the `.focused` state.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (2/2/2026, 17:08:44 & 5/2/2026, 13:32:40):**
    *   Initialized `window.AppGlobal.KeyMemory` for handling key combinations.
    *   Defined `window.AppGlobal.keyCombinations` for ad enabling/disabling via specific key sequences (e.g., "123", "321", player buttons).
    *   `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartTV` function handles keydown events for navigation (up, down, left, right, enter) and back/escape actions, which can open an exit app modal.
    *   Includes platform-specific key handling for WebOS and Tizen (play, pause, stop, rewind, fast forward).
    *   The second change on 5/2/2026, 13:32:40, notably comments out `e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation();` at the beginning of `onKeyDownHandler` and also comments out the `dispatchRewindEvent()` and `dispatchFastForwardEvent()` calls within the platform-specific key handling. It also removes the `THROTTLE_MS` and related `lastTs` throttling logic.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\index.jsx` (2/2/2026, 17:36:09 & 2/2/2026, 17:36:22):**
    *   Established `window.AppMenu` for managing menu state (selected level 1/2, `justArrived`).
    *   Handles menu visibility, authentication context, settings, and dynamic menu data generation based on user type (kid/adult).
    *   Includes `attachSearchAtTheBeginning` to prepend a search option to the menu.
    *   Manages menu opening/closing and navigation between main and sub-menus (Explore, User).
    *   The second timestamp on 2/2/2026, 17:36:22, adds `window.__isEntry = isMenuVisible;` within a `useEffect` hook. Otherwise, the changes are minimal and seem to be a re-save or minor formatting.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\onboarding\usersScreen\index.jsx` (multiple timestamps between 2/2/2026, 17:45:11 and 2/2/2026, 18:14:59):**
    *   Manages user selection, including regular users, "Super3" (kid mode), and adding new users.
    *   Sets up navigation to `/home`, `/usersScreen`, or `/addUserScreen`.
    *   Handles `isLoading` state with a `Spinner`.
    *   The `onBackClick` for `PageHead` was changed from `window.__isEntry ? window.AppGlobal.Actions.openExitAppModal : undefined` to `window.AppGlobal.Actions.openExitAppModal` at 18:04:11.
    *   A significant change at 18:05:33, where `window.__isEntry = location.state?.isEntry || false;` was explicitly changed to `window.__isEntry = true;` and then commented out at 18:06:13, with `window.__isEntry = true;` moved into a `useEffect` hook at 18:10:38.
    *   At 18:14:59, `window.__isEntry = true;` and its usage in `onBackClick` were removed, and `window.__foceEntry = true;` was introduced within its own `useEffect` for force-entry behavior, with a cleanup function to set it back to `false`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\utils\goBackHistory.js` (2/2/2026, 18:15:16):**
    *   Modified the `goBackHistory` function to check for `window.__isEntry` or `window.__foceEntry` to trigger a `callBackFunc()` (likely an exit app modal). This indicates a new mechanism for handling app exit on specific entry points.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (multiple timestamps between 2/2/2026, 18:50:50 and 2/2/2026, 19:14:36):**
    *   The main application component, defining routing, context providers, and global actions.
    *   Includes `InitDevConsole` and `BuildInfo` components for debugging and displaying build information.
    *   `AppInner` manages exit/logout modals.
    *   Multiple small changes across timestamps primarily involve commenting/uncommenting lines related to `window.isUserModalVisible` and `window.AppMenu.manageFocused()` within the `openExitAppModal` function. Some instances of `window.AppMenu?.exitMenu?.()` were added or removed.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\tizen\3cat_pro\config.xml` (3/2/2026, 13:24:24 & 5/2/2026, 10:47:12 & 5/2/2026, 11:41:17):**
    *   XML configuration for a Tizen application.
    *   Changes involve updating the `id` attribute of the `<widget>` element from `http://tizen.tv3.ccma.cat.qa` to `http://tizen.qa.ccma.cat` at 5/2/2026, 10:47:12. This suggests a change in the application's unique identifier, possibly related to deployment environments.
    *   The `package` and `id` attributes of `<tizen:application>` were also updated accordingly. The content itself is generally stable apart from these identifiers.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx` (multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 11:36:24 and 4/2/2026, 14:01:29):**
    *   Component for displaying round items in rows.
    *   Initially had logic to differentiate image formats for `isKidsProfile`. This logic was commented out at 4/2/2026, 12:21:39, meaning `isKidsProfile` no longer affects the `image_format` lookup directly within this component, only the `type` for CSS classing.
    *   The `isKidsProfile` prop was removed from the component at 4/2/2026, 12:56:53.
    *   Re-introduced `isBigRound` prop at 4/2/2026, 13:35:58, which affects image format lookup (for `big-round`) and CSS classes.
    *   Modified `data-nav-fixed-focus-shape` attribute to dynamically use `'bigRound'` or `'round'` based on `isBigRound` at 4/2/2026, 14:01:29.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\rowUtils.js` (4/2/2026, 12:01:27 & 4/2/2026, 12:01:36):**
    *   Function `getRowkind` determines the type of row based on `rowData` properties.
    *   Changed `rowData.format === 'square-mini'` to `rowData.format === 'square_mini'` for `ROUND` row kind at 4/2/2026, 12:01:36 (a minor string format correction).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (4/2/2026, 12:02:26 & 4/2/2026, 12:49:54 & 4/2/2026, 12:54:35 & 4/2/2026, 13:22:28):**
    *   `getRowElement` and `getShowAllElementsFocusShape` functions determine the item component and focus shape based on `rowType`.
    *   `generateShowAllElements` creates the "Show All" item for rows with more content.
    *   Added `case 'SQUARE_MINI': return SquareItem;` to `getRowElement` and `case 'SQUARE_MINI': return 'square';` to `getShowAllElementsFocusShape` at 4/2/2026, 12:49:54.
    *   A line `<div className="roundItemTitle">{item.title}</div>` was added conditional on `isKidsProfile` at 4/2/2026, 12:49:54, and then removed at 4/2/2026, 12:54:35. This suggests an attempt to conditionally render titles for kid profiles within generic rows, which was reverted.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.kids.scss` (multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:22:36 and 4/2/2026, 14:12:14):**
    *   Styles for kid mode `.roundElement` items.
    *   Initially set a purple background and border at 4/2/2026, 12:22:48 and 12:23:43.
    *   These properties (`background-color`, `border`) were frequently added and removed, indicating active experimentation with kid-mode styling for round items.
    *   The `border` property was re-added and then removed multiple times, suggesting a back-and-forth decision on whether kid-mode round items should have a distinct border. The final state at 4/2/2026, 14:12:14, only sets `background-color`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.kids.scss` (multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:26:49 and 4/2/2026, 14:14:40):**
    *   Styles for the fixed focus indicator in kid mode.
    *   Frequent changes in `box-shadow`, `outline`, and `border-color` for the `.inner` element, typically using `$base-color-3cat-kid-light-purple`.
    *   Introduced and removed a specific `.round` selector within `kid-mode .fixed-focus` multiple times, adjusting its `width`, `height`, `box-shadow`, and `border`.
    *   Later, modified the `.round` selector to `.round, &.big-round` and set `outline: 0px;` at 4/2/2026, 14:14:22 and 14:14:40, indicating that round and big-round focus elements in kid mode should have no outline.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\index.jsx` (multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:27:53 and 4/2/2026, 13:42:39):**
    *   Removes `isKidsProfile` from being passed to `RoundItem` at 4/2/2026, 12:30:58.
    *   Reintroduces `isBigRound` prop at 4/2/2026, 13:35:58, which affects `textAlign` of `roundItemWrapper` and also conditionally renders a `roundItemTitle`.
    *   Changes the main div's class name to dynamically be `biground_row` or `round_row` based on `isBigRound` at 4/2/2026, 13:38:35.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\styles.scss` (4/2/2026, 12:28:04 & 4/2/2026, 13:40:37):**
    *   Initial styling for `.round_row` and its inner elements.
    *   The second update at 4/2/2026, 13:40:37, introduces `.biground_row` with a different height, and consolidates common styles for both `round_row` and `biground_row`, including adding styles for `roundItemTitle`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\styles.kids.scss` (4/2/2026, 12:30:18):**
    *   A commented-out style for `height` in `.kid-mode .round_row`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.scss` (multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 14:02:04 and 4/2/2026, 14:26:32):**
    *   Added a new `.bigRound` focus shape with specific `width`, `height`, `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, and `border`.
    *   Initially used `$base-color-3cat-red` for `.bigRound` at 14:02:04, then changed to `$base-color-3cat-kid-light-purple` at 14:02:35.
    *   Later changed `box-shadow` and `border` for `.bigRound` to use `$base-color-3cat-kid-white` with `!important` at 14:26:06.
    *   Updated the `.page` section to include `.bigRound` alongside `.round` for `fixed-focus` positioning at 14:09:26.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.kids.scss` (4/2/2026, 14:18:09):**
    *   Added a new style for `.V-SCROLLABLE:not(.fixed) .focused` in `kid-mode`, applying a purple box-shadow and border.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\index.jsx` (4/2/2026, 15:12:08 & 4/2/2026, 15:15:17 & 4/2/2026, 15:17:01):**
    *   Initial creation of the `ExternalContentModal` component for displaying details of external content.
    *   Uses `PopupInfoGroup`, `GenericButton`, `ImageCropper`, and various icons.
    *   Focuses on `btn-open-external` on mount and restores focus on unmount.
    *   At 15:15:17, added `partner` class dynamically to `popupLeft` based on `isPartner`.
    *   At 15:17:01, `generateImageData` call adjusted `h` parameter to `isPartner ? 428 : 544`, indicating a different image height for partner content.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss` (4/2/2026, 15:15:02):**
    *   Styles for the external content modal, defining its overlay, popup layout, left (image) and right (info, buttons) sections.
    *   Includes specific styles for `promoTextRow` and `platformTextRow`.
    *   Added `.partner` style to `popupLeft` to adjust height for partner content.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\libs\img.js` (multiple timestamps between 5/2/2026, 9:38:25 and 5/2/2026, 9:46:57):**
    *   Utility functions for image handling, including `getImgProxyUrl`, `removeItemsFromArray`, `getBestImage`, `getBestImageV2`, `getLogoImage`, `getImageByFormat`, `generateImageData`, and `generateImageDataFromLiveChannelInHome_v2`.
    *   Frequent modifications to `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` array, especially in `getBestImageV2`, where `square-round` and `big-round` image formats were added to the list of formats to exclude for landscape images, then `square-round` was removed and re-added to `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` in `getBestImage`.
    *   The `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` array for `getBestImage` was `['logo', 'triangular', 'logo-greyscale', 'white-logo', 'round', 'round',]` and then changed to `['logo', 'triangular', 'logo-greyscale', 'white-logo', 'round']` (removed a duplicate 'round') at 9:44:04.
    *   `getBestImageV2` consistently adds `portrait`, `portrait-audio`, `square-audio`, `square-round`, `big-round`, and `portrait-english` to a local `notAllowedFomats` array if the desired aspect is 'LANDSCAPE'.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

1.  **Kid Mode / User Type Specifics:** Many changes revolve around distinguishing between "kid mode" (Super3) and regular user mode. This includes:
    *   Conditional rendering of menu items (`SideMenu`).
    *   Conditional fetching of home data (`Page`).
    *   Specific styling for focused items (`fixedFocus.kids.scss`, `App.kids.scss`).
    *   Image format selection (`roundItem/index.jsx`, `img.js`).
    *   Filtering of content rows (`Page`).

2.  **Focus Management and Keyboard Navigation:**
    *   Extensive use of `nav.focusById`, `registerFocusAction`, `unregisterFocusAction` across components (`RoundItem`, `GenericRow`, `SideMenu`, `ExternalContentModal`, `UsersScreen`).
    *   `fixedFocus.scss` and `fixedFocus.kids.scss` define various focus shapes and their styling, with frequent adjustments, particularly for round and "big round" items.
    *   `platform\generic.js` shows a robust keyboard navigation system, including custom key combinations and platform-specific key handling for Smart TVs.

3.  **UI/UX Refinements for Content Display:**
    *   Components like `infoGroup`, `mediaTitle`, `portraitItem`, `roundItem`, `genericRow`, and `externalContentModal` received updates to how content details (titles, descriptions, dates, logos, external links) are displayed and styled.
    *   Introduction of "Show All" elements in rows (`genericRow`) to handle more items than initially displayed.
    *   Dynamic sizing and styling of elements based on content type (`externalContentModal`, `roundRow`).

4.  **Application Lifecycle and Modals:**
    *   `App.jsx` and `SideMenu.jsx` frequently deal with application state, user authentication, and the presentation/handling of various modals (exit app, logout, external content, user selection).
    *   The `openExitAppModal` function and related `window.isUserModalVisible` state are recurring elements in the `App.jsx` and `generic.js` changes, indicating a common mechanism for handling application exit or modal visibility.
    *   The `window.__isEntry` and `window.__foceEntry` flags in `usersScreen` and `goBackHistory` suggest mechanisms for controlling back navigation behavior, especially when the app is launched directly into certain screens or is in a "force entry" state.

5.  **Image Handling and Optimization (`src\libs\img.js`):**
    *   The `img.js` file is heavily modified, especially `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` and `getBestImageV2`. This indicates ongoing work on selecting and displaying optimal images based on aspect ratio, size, and specific image formats, with a clear separation for logo and "round" image types, and further refinements for different screen orientations and content types.

6.  **Platform Specifics:**
    *   Explicit checks for `window.AppGlobal.platform` (`webos`, `tizen`, `hbbtv`) are present in `generic.js` for key handling and in `Page.jsx` for content filtering.
    *   The `config.xml` for Tizen shows platform-specific application metadata and privileges.

Overall, the changes indicate active development on a smart TV application, focusing on improving user experience (navigation, content display), adapting to different user profiles (kid mode), and ensuring platform compatibility and robust error handling. The frequent modifications to styling and image utilities suggest a strong emphasis on visual presentation and performance.
