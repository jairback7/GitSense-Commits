# Activity Summary for 25/2/2026

## 1:16:46
The provided log details changes across several JavaScript and SCSS files within a `3cat_smarttv` project, primarily focusing on reactivity, state management, and platform-specific behaviors.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 20/2/2026, 12:11:57 - 20/2/2026, 12:12:08:** The `live_refresh_interval` variable was commented out with `//settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000;` and explicitly set to `3000` then `10000`. This suggests testing or adjusting the live data refresh rate.
    *   **Timestamp: 20/2/2026, 12:27:43:** The `live_refresh_interval` was reverted to dynamically use `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`, indicating a preference for configuration-driven refresh rates.
    *   **Timestamp: 23/2/2026, 15:47:34:** The `live_refresh_interval` was again explicitly set to `3000`, similar to the earlier change, suggesting further testing or a temporary override.
    *   **Timestamp: 23/2/2026, 16:47:49 - 23/2/2026, 17:13:02:** The `live_refresh_interval` reverted to `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`, confirming that the previous changes were likely temporary. There were also minor formatting changes (whitespace) in `checkTimeFrame` and `filterChildren` functions across these timestamps.
    *   **Timestamp: 23/2/2026, 17:31:09:** In the `checkTimeFrame` function, the `setPageData` call was commented out (`/*setPageData(...)*/`) and `homeDataRef.current` was directly updated, followed by setting `setPageData` with the updated ref. This suggests an attempt to control re-renders or state updates more precisely.
    *   **Timestamp: 23/2/2026, 17:32:44:** The `checkTimeFrame` function was significantly modified to implement a more controlled re-rendering strategy. It now creates a `newData` object and only calls `setPageData(newData)` and `setIsLoading(false)` if `!hasRefreshed.current`, then sets `hasRefreshed.current = true`. This optimizes initial load vs. subsequent live data refreshes.
    *   **Timestamp: 23/2/2026, 19:01:47:** The logic for controlled re-rendering introduced at `17:32:44` was commented out entirely within `checkTimeFrame`. The `setPageData` call was reverted to directly update the state with a full clone of `homeDataRef.current`.
    *   **Timestamp: 23/2/2026, 19:09:03:** The `checkTimeFrame` function was refactored for improved reactivity and immutability. It now identifies `livePositionsToUpdate` using a `Set`, handles slider updates immutably, and conditionally updates `pageData` based on whether it's the "first time" (full render) or subsequent updates (only live rows). This is a substantial change focusing on performance and state management.
    *   **Timestamp: 23/2/2026, 23:31:18 - 23/2/2026, 23:36:38:** A `console.log(homeDataRef.current);` was added in `checkTimeFrame`, then removed. An `setInterval` was briefly added within `checkTimeFrame` to trigger `setPageData` every 2 seconds, which was then removed. This indicates debugging and experimentation with refresh intervals and state updates.
    *   **Timestamp: 23/2/2026, 23:39:38:** The `live_refresh_interval` was explicitly set to `2000`, overriding the `settingsData` value.
    *   **Timestamp: 23/2/2026, 23:43:50 - 24/2/2026, 0:14:17:** The `live_refresh_interval` was reverted back to `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`, and a temporary `console.log` and `setInterval` logic within `checkTimeFrame` (similar to 23:31:18) were added, modified, and removed, then re-added and removed. These iterations show ongoing debugging of the `checkTimeFrame` logic. A new `newChildren` variable was introduced and passed to `setPageData`. A complex `setPageData` logic with `prev.children === newChildren` comparison was introduced to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
    *   **Timestamp: 24/2/2026, 12:55:28 - 24/2/2026, 13:07:23:** The `checkTimeFrame` function saw further refactoring related to `setPageData`. It introduced a conditional `if(isLoading)` block for the initial `setPageData` call, then for subsequent updates, it assigned the filtered children to a local `c` variable and then `setPageData` with it. A `setTimeout` was added to filter out the 3rd item from children, first with 1ms, then 10s, then 20s delay, suggesting testing dynamic content changes and delays. The `live_refresh_interval` was temporarily changed to `6000000`. A new state `filteredChildren` was added and briefly used within `checkTimeFrame` logic.
    *   **Timestamp: 24/2/2026, 13:07:41:** `live_refresh_interval` was set to `6000000` (very long interval), and the `setTimeout` to filter out an item was retained at 10000ms.
    *   **Timestamp: 24/2/2026, 13:10:49:** Formatting (quotes and line breaks) was adjusted. `live_refresh_interval` remained `6000000`, and the `setTimeout` to remove the 3rd item after 20000ms was still present.
    *   **Timestamp: 24/2/2026, 13:34:57:** A new `prevChildrenCount` ref was added to track the number of children. The `setPageData` logic in `checkTimeFrame` was heavily revised to handle changes in the number of rows (`rowsChanged`). If `rowsChanged` is true, it resets `accumulatedTop`, `accumulatedTranslate`, `currentRow`, and `visibleRows` for virtualization. The `setTimeout` with `splice(3,1)` was removed, then re-added.
    *   **Timestamp: 24/2/2026, 13:40:08:** A new `useEffect` hook was added. This hook simulates live data updates every 10 seconds by cloning `homeDataRef.current.children`, marking items as "active," and explicitly splicing out the 3rd item (index 3) if there are more than 2 children. This is a testing/mocking mechanism for dynamic content changes. The `checkTimeFrame` now directly calls `setPageData` with `filterChildren` and handles `rowsChanged` by manually resetting `accumulatedTop`, `accumulatedTranslate`, `currentRow`, and `visibleRows` via `set` functions.
    *   **Timestamp: 24/2/2026, 13:40:13 - 24/2/2026, 13:56:06:** The manually added `useEffect` for simulating live data was removed. The `setPageData` logic within `checkTimeFrame` was refined, specifically the handling of `rowsChanged`. If `rowsChanged` is true, `resetVirtualization()` is called. The `newChildren.splice(3,1)` line was removed again. The `prevChildrenCount` ref was still present but unused after the simulating `useEffect` was removed.
    *   **Timestamp: 24/2/2026, 14:06:51:** The `setPageData` logic for `rowsChanged` now includes `syncVirtualizationWithData(prev.children, newChildren);`
    *   **Timestamp: 24/2/2026, 14:07:27:** The `useVirtualizedRows` hook now explicitly exports `syncVirtualizationWithData`.
    *   **Timestamp: 24/2/2026, 14:14:51 - 24/2/2026, 14:44:26:** In `checkTimeFrame`, the `newChildren.splice(3, 1)` line was re-introduced and then removed again. The logic for `rowsChanged` was further modified, with `resetVirtualization()` and `removeVirtualizationState(location.pathname)` and `resetFixedFocus()` being called, followed by navigating to the current path with `replace: true`. This indicates a more aggressive reset strategy for virtualization and focus when the number of rows changes. The `prevChildrenCount` ref was removed. `live_refresh_interval` was reverted back to settings-driven.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html`**
    *   **Timestamp: 20/2/2026, 12:16:22:** Shaka Player was updated from `shaka-4-7-1.js` to `shaka.4.13.8.js`. Several commented-out `<script>` tags related to player libs were cleaned up.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 20/2/2026, 12:16:57:** Minor formatting changes occurred. The `BrowserRouter` component had `future={{v7_startTransition: true, v7_relativeSplatPath: true}}` added, indicating an update to React Router v7 features.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js`**
    *   **Timestamp: 20/2/2026, 13:13:26:** The `initAppTizen` function gained an event listener for `evExitApplication` that calls `tizen.application.getCurrentApplication().exit()`. This ensures proper application exit on Tizen. Debug logs were added and removed in various `debugTizenAppCommon` calls. `initNetworkStateListener` was added to listen for network state changes and dispatch custom events. `initScreenSaverHelpers` was added to manage the screen saver state.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerLoader.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 20/2/2026, 18:52:39:** The VMAP URL handling was updated. Previously, query parameters were stripped; now, a `build3catVmapUrl` function is used to replace macros with real values, improving dynamic ad tag generation. Global variables `window._currentVODAdTagUrl` is set with the generated VMAP URL if ads are enabled. `window.BufferingIndicator.show()` and `hide()` were integrated into `useEffect` for player loading/unloading.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js`**
    *   **Timestamp: 20/2/2026, 18:58:23 - 20/2/2026, 19:25:16:** The `onKeyDownHandler` function, which manages keyboard navigation for Smart TVs, had its `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` calls uncommented and commented multiple times. This suggests debugging or fine-tuning event handling for input keys. The final state at 19:25:16 shows `e.preventDefault()` is active, but `e.stopPropagation()` is commented out, indicating a decision to allow event propagation after default actions are prevented.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss`**
    *   **Timestamp: 23/2/2026, 12:40:42:** Added `@font-face` definitions for "Bw 3Cat" and "Roboto" fonts, including various weights and styles, supporting both `.ttf` and `.woff` formats. The `body` element's `font-family` was set to "Bw 3Cat", sans-serif.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 23/2/2026, 17:26:19 - 23/2/2026, 17:27:28:** An `setInterval` call to `refresh_LOCAL_FavoritesList` every 3000ms was added and then removed from the initial `useEffect`, suggesting it was either a test or deemed unnecessary for continuous polling.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 23/2/2026, 19:07:16:** Minor formatting changes in prop spreading and `Icon` usage. The logic for displaying `item.h1` and `item.presenter` in the title was updated to use `filter(Boolean).join(' - ')` for cleaner rendering.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 24/2/2026, 10:52:48 - 24/2/2026, 12:54:17:** The `handleRowNavigation` logic was updated to wrap around from the last row to the first when navigating 'down'. It also refined how `visibleRows` are calculated and how `accumulatedTop` is updated to ensure smooth scrolling in the virtualized list. `setCurrentRow` and `setVisibleRows` updates were consolidated.
    *   **Timestamp: 24/2/2026, 14:18:41 - 24/2/2026, 14:18:59:** The `syncVirtualizationWithData` function was exported and then removed from the export list, indicating a change in whether this function should be publicly available from the hook.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 24/2/2026, 20:47:55:** `liveItemHome` was added to `getRowElement` mapping `LIVE_TV` type. The `onFocusAction` for `RowElement` conditional logic (`rowType !== 'FEATURED' && rowType !== 'INLINE' ? item : null`) was added.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Live Data Refresh Logic (`index.jsx` in `views/page`):** There's a consistent pattern of managing and optimizing live data refreshes. The `live_refresh_interval` is frequently tweaked or reverted, indicating continuous testing and adjustment of how often live content is updated. The `checkTimeFrame` function, responsible for merging and filtering live data, undergoes several iterations to improve efficiency and avoid unnecessary re-renders, eventually settling on a more immutable approach and sophisticated state comparison (`prev.children === newChildren`). The `hasRefreshed` ref plays a role in differentiating initial data loads from subsequent refreshes.
*   **Virtualization and Focus Management (`index.jsx` in `views/page`, `useVirtualizedRows.jsx`):** The interaction between `Page` component and `useVirtualizedRows` hook is a central theme. The `Page` component frequently calls `resetVirtualization`, `removeVirtualizationState`, and `resetFixedFocus` in response to various events (menu navigation, user changes, data updates, and even changes in row count), highlighting the importance of maintaining a correct visual state for a Smart TV application. The `useVirtualizedRows` hook itself sees refinements in how it calculates visible rows and manages scroll positions, with particular attention to state immutability.
*   **Platform Specifics (Tizen, HbbTV, WebOS):** The code includes explicit checks for `window.AppGlobal.platform` (e.g., `'hbbtv'`, `'tizen'`, `'webos'`) to apply platform-specific logic, such as filtering content, handling key presses, or managing device features like screen savers. This indicates a multi-platform development strategy.
*   **Debugging and Testing:** Frequent changes involving `console.log`, temporary `setInterval` for data simulation, and quick reverts of values (like `live_refresh_interval`) suggest active debugging and iterative testing of features, especially around data reactivity and UI rendering.
*   **Immutability and Performance:** The refactoring in `checkTimeFrame` to use immutable updates (cloning arrays, creating new objects for state) and the `setPageData` comparison `prev.children === newChildren` in `index.jsx` indicate a strong focus on optimizing React component re-renders for performance.
*   **User and Content Filtering:** The `filterChildren` function consistently filters content based on various criteria, including `isLiveSupportedRef.current`, `isShakaPlayerSupportedRef.current`, platform (`hbbtv`), and `activeUser?.type === UserType.KID`, demonstrating tailored content delivery.

## 2:16:42
The provided log shows a series of code changes across several files, primarily focusing on a `Page` React component, a `useVirtualizedRows` custom hook, and platform-specific keyboard navigation.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (20/2/2026, 12:11:57 - 24/2/2026, 20:50:12)**: This file underwent the most frequent and significant changes.
    *   **Initial State and Live Refresh Interval (20/2/2026, 12:11:57 - 20/2/2026, 12:12:08)**: The `live_refresh_interval` variable was initially hardcoded to `3000` ms, then commented out and set to `10000` ms, and later reverted to using `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`. This indicates experimentation with the live data refresh rate.
    *   **Live Data Handling Refinements (23/2/2026, 19:09:03)**: The `checkTimeFrame` function saw a major refactor. Instead of directly mutating `homeDataRef.current.children`, it introduced a `livePositionsToUpdate` Set to track which rows need updates and then created new references for only those rows when updating `pageData` via `setPageData`. This change was aimed at optimizing re-renders by avoiding unnecessary updates of unchanged rows, particularly for subsequent live data refreshes.
    *   **Virtualization and State Management (23/2/2026, 23:31:18 - 24/2/2026, 14:44:26)**: Numerous changes focused on how `pageData` is updated and how virtualization state is managed when the underlying data changes.
        *   Initial attempts (23/2/2026, 23:31:18, 23:33:59) tried to directly set `pageData` within `checkTimeFrame` or introduced a `setInterval` for updates, which were later reverted or refined.
        *   A `hasRefreshed` ref was introduced and used in `checkTimeFrame` (23/2/2026, 17:32:44) to distinguish between the initial full render and subsequent partial updates for live rows.
        *   There were several modifications (24/2/2026, 0:04:01, 0:08:59, 13:43:58, 14:06:51) in `checkTimeFrame`'s `setPageData` logic, including attempts to optimize re-renders by comparing old and new `children` arrays, adjusting `currentRow` and `visibleRows` on data changes, and sometimes calling `resetVirtualization()` or navigating back to the current path (`navigate(location.pathname, { replace: true })`) when the number of rows changed.
        *   A temporary `useEffect` with a `setInterval` was added (24/2/2026, 13:40:08) to simulate live data changes and row removals (specifically removing the item at index 3 every 10 seconds). This was likely for testing the live refresh and data virtualization logic. This temporary logic was removed in subsequent commits (24/2/2026, 14:15:20 onwards).
    *   **Removal of Redundant `syncVirtualizationWithData` Import (24/2/2026, 14:15:20)**: The `syncVirtualizationWithData` function was incorrectly imported in a `useVirtualizedRows` hook destructuring assignment and subsequently removed.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html` (20/2/2026, 12:16:22)**:
    *   Updated Shaka Player library to `shaka.4.13.8.js`.
    *   Added a `<script>` tag for `ima3.js` from `imasdk.googleapis.com`, indicating integration with Google Interactive Media Ads.
    *   Introduced `purple-console.min.js` and `easy.qrcode.min.js` scripts.
    *   Adjusted meta viewport for consistent scaling (`maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0`).
    *   Added `playerContainer`, `cueContainer`, and `video-container` divs to the `body`, likely for the media player structure.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (20/2/2026, 12:16:57)**:
    *   Added `BrowserRouter` with `future` props (`v7_startTransition: true, v7_relativeSplatPath: true`).
    *   Introduced new routing paths like `/qrAuthScreen`, `/addUserScreen`, `/signupScreen`, `/my-list`, `/continue-watching`, `/epg`, and `/configuration`.
    *   Included new context providers: `DidomiProvider`, `ParentalControlProvider`, `VirtualizationProvider`, and `HighlightProvider`.
    *   Added `VideoSpinner` component.
    *   Expanded `BuildInfo` component to display more environment and player debug information, such as `VITE_ENV`, `VITE_APP_VERSION`, `VITE_BUILD_NUMBER`, `VITE_BUILD_DATE`, `Platform`, `OS version`, `window resolution`, `screen resolution`, player info, media type, and ads info.
    *   Modified `AppInner`'s `handleOk` logic for `ModalTypes.EXIT` to dispatch `evChangeUser` for KID users and `evExitApplication` for others, with specific navigation behavior.
    *   Removed `window.AppGlobal.ApiMemory.functions.removeSlug('FAVORITES')` from `onReset` in one of the versions, then re-added it in later versions of `index.jsx` (likely indicating a refactor or re-evaluation of this cleanup).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (20/2/2026, 13:13:26)**:
    *   Enhanced Tizen platform-specific functionality.
    *   Added `ajsrConsole` debug logging for device info and Tizen AppCommon properties.
    *   Refined `visibilitychange` event listener to pause/stop player on hide and play on resume, also calling `window.AppGlobal.Actions.onVisibilityChange()`.
    *   Added an `evExitApplication` event listener to gracefully exit the Tizen application.
    *   Implemented `initNetworkStateListener` to dispatch `evNetworkDisconnected` and `evNetworkConnected` events.
    *   Updated `initScreenSaverHelpers` to manage screen saver status and debug info.
    *   Extended `initExtraSamsungKeys` to register more keys (`0-9`, `ChannelDown`, `ChannelUp`).
    *   Added `launchAppTizen` and `openSamsungStore` functions for launching other apps and opening the Samsung store.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerLoader.jsx` (20/2/2026, 18:52:39)**:
    *   Refined ad handling logic by replacing a simple query stripping with `build3catVmapUrl` and `getVmapParamsPlatform` functions for constructing VMAP URLs with dynamic macros.
    *   Modified `time_markers` logic to conditionally add/remove a "credits" marker based on `autoplay` and `relatedData` presence, and `auto_next_episode_seconds` setting.
    *   Added subtitles style management (`setSubtitlesStyles`, `removeSubtitlesStyles`) based on `optionsProvider` settings.
    *   Ensured screen saver is disabled when player loads and re-enabled on cleanup.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (20/2/2026, 18:58:23 - 20/2/2026, 19:25:16)**:
    *   Introduced `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` to the `onKeyDownHandler` (20/2/2026, 19:05:58), then removed `e.stopPropagation()` (20/2/2026, 19:15:17), and finally re-added `e.stopPropagation()` at the end of the handler (20/2/2026, 19:21:43) and subsequently removed it again (20/2/2026, 19:25:16). This indicates debugging and refinement of event handling.
    *   The core functionality of `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartTV` remained consistent, handling various key codes for navigation, action, and media playback across generic, WebOS, and Tizen platforms.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss` (23/2/2026, 12:40:42)**:
    *   Added a comprehensive set of `@font-face` rules for "Bw 3Cat" and "Roboto" font families, including various weights (Thin, Light, Regular, Medium, Bold, Heavy, Black, Dotted, Rounded) and formats (`.ttf`, `.woff`).
    *   Set the default `body` font family to "Bw 3Cat".

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 17:26:19 - 23/2/2026, 17:27:28)**:
    *   Removed a `setInterval` that was refreshing local favorites every 3 seconds from the `useEffect` hook, streamlining the favorite status update to rely solely on the `item` prop.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 19:07:16)**:
    *   Introduced a new component `LiveItemHome` to display live content on the home screen.
    *   Uses `useMemo` for `imgData`, `channelLogo`, `percentage`, and `mediaType` for optimization.
    *   Integrates `useExternalEmission` hook to determine if content is live external and get tag text.
    *   Includes conditional rendering for "EN DIRECTE" tag and upcoming tag.
    *   Registers and unregisters focus actions using `registerFocusAction` and `unregisterFocusAction`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx` (24/2/2026, 10:52:48 - 24/2/2026, 14:18:59)**:
    *   The `useVirtualizedRows` hook received several updates to its `handleRowNavigation` logic, specifically around how `visibleRows`, `accumulatedTranslate`, and `accumulatedTop` are managed during navigation, especially when wrapping from the last row to the first.
    *   Initial logic (24/2/2026, 10:52:48) calculated `start` and `newVisibleRows` but updated `visibleRows` directly based on `start`.
    *   A major change (24/2/2026, 10:56:20) refined the `handleRowNavigation` to correctly adjust `accumulatedTop` only when the `start` index of visible rows changed. It also explicitly set `visibleRows` and `currentRow` to 0 when wrapping from the last row to the first.
    *   The `syncVirtualizationWithData` function was added as a return value (24/2/2026, 14:18:41) but was not fully implemented in the provided logs. It was later removed from the destructuring in `index.jsx`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (24/2/2026, 20:47:55)**:
    *   Updated the `getRowElement` mapping to include `LiveItemHome` for `LIVE_TV` type and `LastDayItem` for `LAST_DAYS`.
    *   Modified `getShowAllElementsFocusShape` to return appropriate shapes for new row types.
    *   Introduced a more flexible `generateShowAllElements` function to create the "Show All" component.
    *   Added logic to handle `HERO` and `FEATURED` row types, including limiting `rowItems` to the first item for `FEATURED` and using `rowData` directly for `HERO` if no `rowItems` are present.
    *   Included `isExternalRow` detection and styling.
    *   Added `onNeedLogin` prop to `RowElement` for handling login requirements.
    *   Added `showAudioIcon` prop to `RowElement` based on `item.media_type`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Live Data Refresh Logic:** There's a consistent pattern of fetching "Now Playing" data (`ApiGetNowPlaying`, `ApiGetNowPlayingSelector`) and using `checkTimeFrame` to update live content within the `pageData`. This process involves:
    *   Filtering data based on `start_date` and `end_date`.
    *   Merging original data with API stream data.
    *   Replacing or removing items in `directesChildren` based on live status.
    *   Updating `sliderItem` children with matching stream data.
    *   This logic is often wrapped in `setInterval` calls, indicating a continuous polling mechanism for live updates. The interval value (`live_refresh_interval`) is adjusted and commented out across various commits, highlighting ongoing fine-tuning of performance versus real-time updates.

2.  **React State and Ref Management:**
    *   Heavy use of `useState` for UI state (`isLoading`, `error`, `pageData`) and `useRef` for mutable values that don't trigger re-renders (`hasRefreshed`, `homeDataRef`, `nowPlayingSelectorTimmerRef`).
    *   `useEffect` hooks are extensively used for side effects: data fetching (`getHomeData`, `getPageData`), event listeners (`menu:navigate`, `evChangeUser`, `customNavigation`), and cleanup.
    *   There's an observable effort to optimize re-renders by comparing previous and new state values (e.g., `prev.children === newChildren` check in `setPageData`) and using immutable updates.

3.  **Virtualization Integration:** The `useVirtualizedRows` hook is a central component, managing visible rows, scroll positions, and focus within a potentially large list of rows.
    *   It relies on a `VirtualizationContext` for saving and retrieving page state, allowing navigation state persistence.
    *   The `handleRowNavigation` callback manages vertical scrolling and updates `visibleRows`, `accumulatedTranslate`, and `accumulatedTop`.
    *   `resetVirtualization` and `removeVirtualizationState` functions are provided for cleanup and state reset.

4.  **Platform-Specific Adaptations (`window.AppGlobal.platform`):**
    *   The codebase frequently checks `window.AppGlobal.platform` to apply platform-specific logic, such as filtering content (e.g., hiding external content on `hbbtv`), or handling keyboard events (`generic.js`, `tizen.js`).
    *   The `App.jsx` file also uses `isHbbTV` to determine initial navigation routes and specific modal handling.

5.  **Debugging and Development Features:**
    *   Extensive `console.log` and `ajsrConsole.log` calls are present throughout the code, indicating a strong focus on debugging and providing internal state visibility.
    *   The `App.jsx` includes a `BuildInfo` component that exposes various build and environment details, along with `DebugConfigPane`, `DebugSessionSettingsPane`, and `DebugModalsLauncher`, suggesting robust internal tooling for development and testing.

6.  **Navigation and Focus Management (`nav` object):** The `nav` global object (likely a custom navigation library) is frequently used for managing focus, triggering actions, and controlling navigation state (`nav.move.up()`, `nav.action()`, `nav.fixedFocus.isNavigating`).

In summary, the changes reflect ongoing development of a Smart TV application, with a strong emphasis on dynamic content updates (especially live streams), efficient rendering through virtualization, platform compatibility, and comprehensive debugging tools. The evolution of the `Page` component's `checkTimeFrame` and `setPageData` logic, along with the `useVirtualizedRows` hook, points to efforts in optimizing performance and user experience for data-intensive UIs.
