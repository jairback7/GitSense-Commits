# Activity Summary for 25/2/2026

## 1:16:46
The provided log details changes across several JavaScript and SCSS files within a `3cat_smarttv` project, primarily focusing on reactivity, state management, and platform-specific behaviors.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 20/2/2026, 12:11:57 - 20/2/2026, 12:12:08:** The `live_refresh_interval` variable was commented out with `//settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000;` and explicitly set to `3000` then `10000`. This suggests testing or adjusting the live data refresh rate.
    *   **Timestamp: 20/2/2026, 12:27:43:** The `live_refresh_interval` was reverted to dynamically use `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`, indicating a preference for configuration-driven refresh rates.
    *   **Timestamp: 23/2/2026, 15:47:34:** The `live_refresh_interval` was again explicitly set to `3000`, similar to the earlier change, suggesting further testing or a temporary override.
    *   **Timestamp: 23/2/2026, 16:47:49 - 23/2/2026, 17:13:02:** The `live_refresh_interval` reverted to `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`, confirming that the previous changes were likely temporary. There were also minor formatting changes (whitespace) in `checkTimeFrame` and `filterChildren` functions across these timestamps.
    *   **Timestamp: 23/2/2026, 17:31:09:** In the `checkTimeFrame` function, the `setPageData` call was commented out (`/*setPageData(...)*/`) and `homeDataRef.current` was directly updated, followed by setting `setPageData` with the updated ref. This suggests an attempt to control re-renders or state updates more precisely.
    *   **Timestamp: 23/2/2026, 17:32:44:** The `checkTimeFrame` function was significantly modified to implement a more controlled re-rendering strategy. It now creates a `newData` object and only calls `setPageData(newData)` and `setIsLoading(false)` if `!hasRefreshed.current`, then sets `hasRefreshed.current = true`. This optimizes initial load vs. subsequent live data refreshes.
    *   **Timestamp: 23/2/2026, 19:01:47:** The logic for controlled re-rendering introduced at `17:32:44` was commented out entirely within `checkTimeFrame`. The `setPageData` call was reverted to directly update the state with a full clone of `homeDataRef.current`.
    *   **Timestamp: 23/2/2026, 19:09:03:** The `checkTimeFrame` function was refactored for improved reactivity and immutability. It now identifies `livePositionsToUpdate` using a `Set`, handles slider updates immutably, and conditionally updates `pageData` based on whether it's the "first time" (full render) or subsequent updates (only live rows). This is a substantial change focusing on performance and state management.
    *   **Timestamp: 23/2/2026, 23:31:18 - 23/2/2026, 23:36:38:** A `console.log(homeDataRef.current);` was added in `checkTimeFrame`, then removed. An `setInterval` was briefly added within `checkTimeFrame` to trigger `setPageData` every 2 seconds, which was then removed. This indicates debugging and experimentation with refresh intervals and state updates.
    *   **Timestamp: 23/2/2026, 23:39:38:** The `live_refresh_interval` was explicitly set to `2000`, overriding the `settingsData` value.
    *   **Timestamp: 23/2/2026, 23:43:50 - 24/2/2026, 0:14:17:** The `live_refresh_interval` was reverted back to `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`, and a temporary `console.log` and `setInterval` logic within `checkTimeFrame` (similar to 23:31:18) were added, modified, and removed, then re-added and removed. These iterations show ongoing debugging of the `checkTimeFrame` logic. A new `newChildren` variable was introduced and passed to `setPageData`. A complex `setPageData` logic with `prev.children === newChildren` comparison was introduced to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
    *   **Timestamp: 24/2/2026, 12:55:28 - 24/2/2026, 13:07:23:** The `checkTimeFrame` function saw further refactoring related to `setPageData`. It introduced a conditional `if(isLoading)` block for the initial `setPageData` call, then for subsequent updates, it assigned the filtered children to a local `c` variable and then `setPageData` with it. A `setTimeout` was added to filter out the 3rd item from children, first with 1ms, then 10s, then 20s delay, suggesting testing dynamic content changes and delays. The `live_refresh_interval` was temporarily changed to `6000000`. A new state `filteredChildren` was added and briefly used within `checkTimeFrame` logic.
    *   **Timestamp: 24/2/2026, 13:07:41:** `live_refresh_interval` was set to `6000000` (very long interval), and the `setTimeout` to filter out an item was retained at 10000ms.
    *   **Timestamp: 24/2/2026, 13:10:49:** Formatting (quotes and line breaks) was adjusted. `live_refresh_interval` remained `6000000`, and the `setTimeout` to remove the 3rd item after 20000ms was still present.
    *   **Timestamp: 24/2/2026, 13:34:57:** A new `prevChildrenCount` ref was added to track the number of children. The `setPageData` logic in `checkTimeFrame` was heavily revised to handle changes in the number of rows (`rowsChanged`). If `rowsChanged` is true, it resets `accumulatedTop`, `accumulatedTranslate`, `currentRow`, and `visibleRows` for virtualization. The `setTimeout` with `splice(3,1)` was removed, then re-added.
    *   **Timestamp: 24/2/2026, 13:40:08:** A new `useEffect` hook was added. This hook simulates live data updates every 10 seconds by cloning `homeDataRef.current.children`, marking items as "active," and explicitly splicing out the 3rd item (index 3) if there are more than 2 children. This is a testing/mocking mechanism for dynamic content changes. The `checkTimeFrame` now directly calls `setPageData` with `filterChildren` and handles `rowsChanged` by manually resetting `accumulatedTop`, `accumulatedTranslate`, `currentRow`, and `visibleRows` via `set` functions.
    *   **Timestamp: 24/2/2026, 13:40:13 - 24/2/2026, 13:56:06:** The manually added `useEffect` for simulating live data was removed. The `setPageData` logic within `checkTimeFrame` was refined, specifically the handling of `rowsChanged`. If `rowsChanged` is true, `resetVirtualization()` is called. The `newChildren.splice(3,1)` line was removed again. The `prevChildrenCount` ref was still present but unused after the simulating `useEffect` was removed.
    *   **Timestamp: 24/2/2026, 14:06:51:** The `setPageData` logic for `rowsChanged` now includes `syncVirtualizationWithData(prev.children, newChildren);`
    *   **Timestamp: 24/2/2026, 14:07:27:** The `useVirtualizedRows` hook now explicitly exports `syncVirtualizationWithData`.
    *   **Timestamp: 24/2/2026, 14:14:51 - 24/2/2026, 14:44:26:** In `checkTimeFrame`, the `newChildren.splice(3, 1)` line was re-introduced and then removed again. The logic for `rowsChanged` was further modified, with `resetVirtualization()` and `removeVirtualizationState(location.pathname)` and `resetFixedFocus()` being called, followed by navigating to the current path with `replace: true`. This indicates a more aggressive reset strategy for virtualization and focus when the number of rows changes. The `prevChildrenCount` ref was removed. `live_refresh_interval` was reverted back to settings-driven.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html`**
    *   **Timestamp: 20/2/2026, 12:16:22:** Shaka Player was updated from `shaka-4-7-1.js` to `shaka.4.13.8.js`. Several commented-out `<script>` tags related to player libs were cleaned up.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 20/2/2026, 12:16:57:** Minor formatting changes occurred. The `BrowserRouter` component had `future={{v7_startTransition: true, v7_relativeSplatPath: true}}` added, indicating an update to React Router v7 features.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js`**
    *   **Timestamp: 20/2/2026, 13:13:26:** The `initAppTizen` function gained an event listener for `evExitApplication` that calls `tizen.application.getCurrentApplication().exit()`. This ensures proper application exit on Tizen. Debug logs were added and removed in various `debugTizenAppCommon` calls. `initNetworkStateListener` was added to listen for network state changes and dispatch custom events. `initScreenSaverHelpers` was added to manage the screen saver state.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerLoader.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 20/2/2026, 18:52:39:** The VMAP URL handling was updated. Previously, query parameters were stripped; now, a `build3catVmapUrl` function is used to replace macros with real values, improving dynamic ad tag generation. Global variables `window._currentVODAdTagUrl` is set with the generated VMAP URL if ads are enabled. `window.BufferingIndicator.show()` and `hide()` were integrated into `useEffect` for player loading/unloading.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js`**
    *   **Timestamp: 20/2/2026, 18:58:23 - 20/2/2026, 19:25:16:** The `onKeyDownHandler` function, which manages keyboard navigation for Smart TVs, had its `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` calls uncommented and commented multiple times. This suggests debugging or fine-tuning event handling for input keys. The final state at 19:25:16 shows `e.preventDefault()` is active, but `e.stopPropagation()` is commented out, indicating a decision to allow event propagation after default actions are prevented.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss`**
    *   **Timestamp: 23/2/2026, 12:40:42:** Added `@font-face` definitions for "Bw 3Cat" and "Roboto" fonts, including various weights and styles, supporting both `.ttf` and `.woff` formats. The `body` element's `font-family` was set to "Bw 3Cat", sans-serif.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 23/2/2026, 17:26:19 - 23/2/2026, 17:27:28:** An `setInterval` call to `refresh_LOCAL_FavoritesList` every 3000ms was added and then removed from the initial `useEffect`, suggesting it was either a test or deemed unnecessary for continuous polling.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 23/2/2026, 19:07:16:** Minor formatting changes in prop spreading and `Icon` usage. The logic for displaying `item.h1` and `item.presenter` in the title was updated to use `filter(Boolean).join(' - ')` for cleaner rendering.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 24/2/2026, 10:52:48 - 24/2/2026, 12:54:17:** The `handleRowNavigation` logic was updated to wrap around from the last row to the first when navigating 'down'. It also refined how `visibleRows` are calculated and how `accumulatedTop` is updated to ensure smooth scrolling in the virtualized list. `setCurrentRow` and `setVisibleRows` updates were consolidated.
    *   **Timestamp: 24/2/2026, 14:18:41 - 24/2/2026, 14:18:59:** The `syncVirtualizationWithData` function was exported and then removed from the export list, indicating a change in whether this function should be publicly available from the hook.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 24/2/2026, 20:47:55:** `liveItemHome` was added to `getRowElement` mapping `LIVE_TV` type. The `onFocusAction` for `RowElement` conditional logic (`rowType !== 'FEATURED' && rowType !== 'INLINE' ? item : null`) was added.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Live Data Refresh Logic (`index.jsx` in `views/page`):** There's a consistent pattern of managing and optimizing live data refreshes. The `live_refresh_interval` is frequently tweaked or reverted, indicating continuous testing and adjustment of how often live content is updated. The `checkTimeFrame` function, responsible for merging and filtering live data, undergoes several iterations to improve efficiency and avoid unnecessary re-renders, eventually settling on a more immutable approach and sophisticated state comparison (`prev.children === newChildren`). The `hasRefreshed` ref plays a role in differentiating initial data loads from subsequent refreshes.
*   **Virtualization and Focus Management (`index.jsx` in `views/page`, `useVirtualizedRows.jsx`):** The interaction between `Page` component and `useVirtualizedRows` hook is a central theme. The `Page` component frequently calls `resetVirtualization`, `removeVirtualizationState`, and `resetFixedFocus` in response to various events (menu navigation, user changes, data updates, and even changes in row count), highlighting the importance of maintaining a correct visual state for a Smart TV application. The `useVirtualizedRows` hook itself sees refinements in how it calculates visible rows and manages scroll positions, with particular attention to state immutability.
*   **Platform Specifics (Tizen, HbbTV, WebOS):** The code includes explicit checks for `window.AppGlobal.platform` (e.g., `'hbbtv'`, `'tizen'`, `'webos'`) to apply platform-specific logic, such as filtering content, handling key presses, or managing device features like screen savers. This indicates a multi-platform development strategy.
*   **Debugging and Testing:** Frequent changes involving `console.log`, temporary `setInterval` for data simulation, and quick reverts of values (like `live_refresh_interval`) suggest active debugging and iterative testing of features, especially around data reactivity and UI rendering.
*   **Immutability and Performance:** The refactoring in `checkTimeFrame` to use immutable updates (cloning arrays, creating new objects for state) and the `setPageData` comparison `prev.children === newChildren` in `index.jsx` indicate a strong focus on optimizing React component re-renders for performance.
*   **User and Content Filtering:** The `filterChildren` function consistently filters content based on various criteria, including `isLiveSupportedRef.current`, `isShakaPlayerSupportedRef.current`, platform (`hbbtv`), and `activeUser?.type === UserType.KID`, demonstrating tailored content delivery.

## 2:16:42
The provided log shows a series of code changes across several files, primarily focusing on a `Page` React component, a `useVirtualizedRows` custom hook, and platform-specific keyboard navigation.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (20/2/2026, 12:11:57 - 24/2/2026, 20:50:12)**: This file underwent the most frequent and significant changes.
    *   **Initial State and Live Refresh Interval (20/2/2026, 12:11:57 - 20/2/2026, 12:12:08)**: The `live_refresh_interval` variable was initially hardcoded to `3000` ms, then commented out and set to `10000` ms, and later reverted to using `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`. This indicates experimentation with the live data refresh rate.
    *   **Live Data Handling Refinements (23/2/2026, 19:09:03)**: The `checkTimeFrame` function saw a major refactor. Instead of directly mutating `homeDataRef.current.children`, it introduced a `livePositionsToUpdate` Set to track which rows need updates and then created new references for only those rows when updating `pageData` via `setPageData`. This change was aimed at optimizing re-renders by avoiding unnecessary updates of unchanged rows, particularly for subsequent live data refreshes.
    *   **Virtualization and State Management (23/2/2026, 23:31:18 - 24/2/2026, 14:44:26)**: Numerous changes focused on how `pageData` is updated and how virtualization state is managed when the underlying data changes.
        *   Initial attempts (23/2/2026, 23:31:18, 23:33:59) tried to directly set `pageData` within `checkTimeFrame` or introduced a `setInterval` for updates, which were later reverted or refined.
        *   A `hasRefreshed` ref was introduced and used in `checkTimeFrame` (23/2/2026, 17:32:44) to distinguish between the initial full render and subsequent partial updates for live rows.
        *   There were several modifications (24/2/2026, 0:04:01, 0:08:59, 13:43:58, 14:06:51) in `checkTimeFrame`'s `setPageData` logic, including attempts to optimize re-renders by comparing old and new `children` arrays, adjusting `currentRow` and `visibleRows` on data changes, and sometimes calling `resetVirtualization()` or navigating back to the current path (`navigate(location.pathname, { replace: true })`) when the number of rows changed.
        *   A temporary `useEffect` with a `setInterval` was added (24/2/2026, 13:40:08) to simulate live data changes and row removals (specifically removing the item at index 3 every 10 seconds). This was likely for testing the live refresh and data virtualization logic. This temporary logic was removed in subsequent commits (24/2/2026, 14:15:20 onwards).
    *   **Removal of Redundant `syncVirtualizationWithData` Import (24/2/2026, 14:15:20)**: The `syncVirtualizationWithData` function was incorrectly imported in a `useVirtualizedRows` hook destructuring assignment and subsequently removed.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html` (20/2/2026, 12:16:22)**:
    *   Updated Shaka Player library to `shaka.4.13.8.js`.
    *   Added a `<script>` tag for `ima3.js` from `imasdk.googleapis.com`, indicating integration with Google Interactive Media Ads.
    *   Introduced `purple-console.min.js` and `easy.qrcode.min.js` scripts.
    *   Adjusted meta viewport for consistent scaling (`maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0`).
    *   Added `playerContainer`, `cueContainer`, and `video-container` divs to the `body`, likely for the media player structure.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (20/2/2026, 12:16:57)**:
    *   Added `BrowserRouter` with `future` props (`v7_startTransition: true, v7_relativeSplatPath: true`).
    *   Introduced new routing paths like `/qrAuthScreen`, `/addUserScreen`, `/signupScreen`, `/my-list`, `/continue-watching`, `/epg`, and `/configuration`.
    *   Included new context providers: `DidomiProvider`, `ParentalControlProvider`, `VirtualizationProvider`, and `HighlightProvider`.
    *   Added `VideoSpinner` component.
    *   Expanded `BuildInfo` component to display more environment and player debug information, such as `VITE_ENV`, `VITE_APP_VERSION`, `VITE_BUILD_NUMBER`, `VITE_BUILD_DATE`, `Platform`, `OS version`, `window resolution`, `screen resolution`, player info, media type, and ads info.
    *   Modified `AppInner`'s `handleOk` logic for `ModalTypes.EXIT` to dispatch `evChangeUser` for KID users and `evExitApplication` for others, with specific navigation behavior.
    *   Removed `window.AppGlobal.ApiMemory.functions.removeSlug('FAVORITES')` from `onReset` in one of the versions, then re-added it in later versions of `index.jsx` (likely indicating a refactor or re-evaluation of this cleanup).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (20/2/2026, 13:13:26)**:
    *   Enhanced Tizen platform-specific functionality.
    *   Added `ajsrConsole` debug logging for device info and Tizen AppCommon properties.
    *   Refined `visibilitychange` event listener to pause/stop player on hide and play on resume, also calling `window.AppGlobal.Actions.onVisibilityChange()`.
    *   Added an `evExitApplication` event listener to gracefully exit the Tizen application.
    *   Implemented `initNetworkStateListener` to dispatch `evNetworkDisconnected` and `evNetworkConnected` events.
    *   Updated `initScreenSaverHelpers` to manage screen saver status and debug info.
    *   Extended `initExtraSamsungKeys` to register more keys (`0-9`, `ChannelDown`, `ChannelUp`).
    *   Added `launchAppTizen` and `openSamsungStore` functions for launching other apps and opening the Samsung store.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerLoader.jsx` (20/2/2026, 18:52:39)**:
    *   Refined ad handling logic by replacing a simple query stripping with `build3catVmapUrl` and `getVmapParamsPlatform` functions for constructing VMAP URLs with dynamic macros.
    *   Modified `time_markers` logic to conditionally add/remove a "credits" marker based on `autoplay` and `relatedData` presence, and `auto_next_episode_seconds` setting.
    *   Added subtitles style management (`setSubtitlesStyles`, `removeSubtitlesStyles`) based on `optionsProvider` settings.
    *   Ensured screen saver is disabled when player loads and re-enabled on cleanup.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (20/2/2026, 18:58:23 - 20/2/2026, 19:25:16)**:
    *   Introduced `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` to the `onKeyDownHandler` (20/2/2026, 19:05:58), then removed `e.stopPropagation()` (20/2/2026, 19:15:17), and finally re-added `e.stopPropagation()` at the end of the handler (20/2/2026, 19:21:43) and subsequently removed it again (20/2/2026, 19:25:16). This indicates debugging and refinement of event handling.
    *   The core functionality of `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartTV` remained consistent, handling various key codes for navigation, action, and media playback across generic, WebOS, and Tizen platforms.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss` (23/2/2026, 12:40:42)**:
    *   Added a comprehensive set of `@font-face` rules for "Bw 3Cat" and "Roboto" font families, including various weights (Thin, Light, Regular, Medium, Bold, Heavy, Black, Dotted, Rounded) and formats (`.ttf`, `.woff`).
    *   Set the default `body` font family to "Bw 3Cat".

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 17:26:19 - 23/2/2026, 17:27:28)**:
    *   Removed a `setInterval` that was refreshing local favorites every 3 seconds from the `useEffect` hook, streamlining the favorite status update to rely solely on the `item` prop.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 19:07:16)**:
    *   Introduced a new component `LiveItemHome` to display live content on the home screen.
    *   Uses `useMemo` for `imgData`, `channelLogo`, `percentage`, and `mediaType` for optimization.
    *   Integrates `useExternalEmission` hook to determine if content is live external and get tag text.
    *   Includes conditional rendering for "EN DIRECTE" tag and upcoming tag.
    *   Registers and unregisters focus actions using `registerFocusAction` and `unregisterFocusAction`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx` (24/2/2026, 10:52:48 - 24/2/2026, 14:18:59)**:
    *   The `useVirtualizedRows` hook received several updates to its `handleRowNavigation` logic, specifically around how `visibleRows`, `accumulatedTranslate`, and `accumulatedTop` are managed during navigation, especially when wrapping from the last row to the first.
    *   Initial logic (24/2/2026, 10:52:48) calculated `start` and `newVisibleRows` but updated `visibleRows` directly based on `start`.
    *   A major change (24/2/2026, 10:56:20) refined the `handleRowNavigation` to correctly adjust `accumulatedTop` only when the `start` index of visible rows changed. It also explicitly set `visibleRows` and `currentRow` to 0 when wrapping from the last row to the first.
    *   The `syncVirtualizationWithData` function was added as a return value (24/2/2026, 14:18:41) but was not fully implemented in the provided logs. It was later removed from the destructuring in `index.jsx`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (24/2/2026, 20:47:55)**:
    *   Updated the `getRowElement` mapping to include `LiveItemHome` for `LIVE_TV` type and `LastDayItem` for `LAST_DAYS`.
    *   Modified `getShowAllElementsFocusShape` to return appropriate shapes for new row types.
    *   Introduced a more flexible `generateShowAllElements` function to create the "Show All" component.
    *   Added logic to handle `HERO` and `FEATURED` row types, including limiting `rowItems` to the first item for `FEATURED` and using `rowData` directly for `HERO` if no `rowItems` are present.
    *   Included `isExternalRow` detection and styling.
    *   Added `onNeedLogin` prop to `RowElement` for handling login requirements.
    *   Added `showAudioIcon` prop to `RowElement` based on `item.media_type`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Live Data Refresh Logic:** There's a consistent pattern of fetching "Now Playing" data (`ApiGetNowPlaying`, `ApiGetNowPlayingSelector`) and using `checkTimeFrame` to update live content within the `pageData`. This process involves:
    *   Filtering data based on `start_date` and `end_date`.
    *   Merging original data with API stream data.
    *   Replacing or removing items in `directesChildren` based on live status.
    *   Updating `sliderItem` children with matching stream data.
    *   This logic is often wrapped in `setInterval` calls, indicating a continuous polling mechanism for live updates. The interval value (`live_refresh_interval`) is adjusted and commented out across various commits, highlighting ongoing fine-tuning of performance versus real-time updates.

2.  **React State and Ref Management:**
    *   Heavy use of `useState` for UI state (`isLoading`, `error`, `pageData`) and `useRef` for mutable values that don't trigger re-renders (`hasRefreshed`, `homeDataRef`, `nowPlayingSelectorTimmerRef`).
    *   `useEffect` hooks are extensively used for side effects: data fetching (`getHomeData`, `getPageData`), event listeners (`menu:navigate`, `evChangeUser`, `customNavigation`), and cleanup.
    *   There's an observable effort to optimize re-renders by comparing previous and new state values (e.g., `prev.children === newChildren` check in `setPageData`) and using immutable updates.

3.  **Virtualization Integration:** The `useVirtualizedRows` hook is a central component, managing visible rows, scroll positions, and focus within a potentially large list of rows.
    *   It relies on a `VirtualizationContext` for saving and retrieving page state, allowing navigation state persistence.
    *   The `handleRowNavigation` callback manages vertical scrolling and updates `visibleRows`, `accumulatedTranslate`, and `accumulatedTop`.
    *   `resetVirtualization` and `removeVirtualizationState` functions are provided for cleanup and state reset.

4.  **Platform-Specific Adaptations (`window.AppGlobal.platform`):**
    *   The codebase frequently checks `window.AppGlobal.platform` to apply platform-specific logic, such as filtering content (e.g., hiding external content on `hbbtv`), or handling keyboard events (`generic.js`, `tizen.js`).
    *   The `App.jsx` file also uses `isHbbTV` to determine initial navigation routes and specific modal handling.

5.  **Debugging and Development Features:**
    *   Extensive `console.log` and `ajsrConsole.log` calls are present throughout the code, indicating a strong focus on debugging and providing internal state visibility.
    *   The `App.jsx` includes a `BuildInfo` component that exposes various build and environment details, along with `DebugConfigPane`, `DebugSessionSettingsPane`, and `DebugModalsLauncher`, suggesting robust internal tooling for development and testing.

6.  **Navigation and Focus Management (`nav` object):** The `nav` global object (likely a custom navigation library) is frequently used for managing focus, triggering actions, and controlling navigation state (`nav.move.up()`, `nav.action()`, `nav.fixedFocus.isNavigating`).

In summary, the changes reflect ongoing development of a Smart TV application, with a strong emphasis on dynamic content updates (especially live streams), efficient rendering through virtualization, platform compatibility, and comprehensive debugging tools. The evolution of the `Page` component's `checkTimeFrame` and `setPageData` logic, along with the `useVirtualizedRows` hook, points to efforts in optimizing performance and user experience for data-intensive UIs.

## 6:18:44
The changes primarily affect the `c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` file, with numerous updates focused on how live content is refreshed and rendered, especially regarding virtualization and dynamic row management.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (20/2/2026, 12:11:57 - 24/2/2026, 20:50:12)**:
    *   **Live Refresh Interval:** Initially set to `3000` ms, then reverted to `10000` ms (or `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval`). There were several temporary changes to `live_refresh_interval` in subsequent commits (e.g., `2000`, `1000`, `6000000`) but it frequently returned to `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`. This indicates a period of experimentation or debugging for the live content refresh rate.
    *   **`checkTimeFrame` function modifications:** This function is central to updating live data.
        *   Initial version directly called `setPageData`.
        *   An intermediate change (23/2/2026, 17:31:09) commented out `setPageData` and instead updated `homeDataRef.current` directly, then called `setPageData` with the updated ref, suggesting an attempt to manage state updates more carefully.
        *   Further changes (23/2/2026, 17:32:44) introduced a `newData` object and conditionally called `setPageData` only if `!hasRefreshed.current`, attempting to optimize initial render versus subsequent live updates.
        *   Another significant modification (23/2/2026, 19:09:03) introduced `livePositionsToUpdate` (a `Set`) to track which rows need updating, aiming for more granular state updates. It differentiated between the "first render" (`!hasRefreshed.current`) and "subsequent renders" (updating only specific live rows). This version also involved more immutable updates for `homeDataRef.current` and its children.
        *   The code repeatedly tried different strategies for updating `pageData` within `checkTimeFrame`, including directly setting `pageData`, using `prev` state, and attempts to filter or splice children arrays (e.g., `newChildren.splice(3, 1)` around 24/2/2026).
        *   Multiple changes involve adding `setTimeout` calls (e.g., 24/2/2026, 13:07:23 and 13:10:49) within `checkTimeFrame` to re-filter and update `pageData` after a delay, often specifically targeting removal of the 3rd item (`index !== 3`). This suggests debugging or testing of dynamic content changes in a delayed manner.
    *   **`useEffect` for simulated data changes:** A new `useEffect` hook (24/2/2026, 13:40:08) was added to `Page` component that simulates data changes by periodically modifying `homeDataRef.current.children` (e.g., setting `start_date`/`end_date` to keep items "active" and `splice` out the 3rd item). This indicates active development and testing of how the UI reacts to underlying data mutations over time, particularly for live content and virtualization.
    *   **Virtualization integration:** The `useVirtualizedRows` hook, which provides `visibleRows`, `accumulatedTranslate`, `accumulatedTop`, `rowRefs`, `idToFocus`, `rowXTranslatePos`, `setRowXTranslatePos`, `removeVirtualizationState`, `resetVirtualization`, and `currentRow`, is consistently used.
    *   **Resetting virtualization on row changes:** Starting around 24/2/2026, 13:45:08, the `setPageData` logic within `checkTimeFrame` began explicitly calling `resetVirtualization()` and `removeVirtualizationState()` if `rowsChanged` (i.e., `prev.children.length != newChildren.length`). This ensures the virtualization state is reset when the structure of rows changes, which is crucial for correct rendering. This logic was further refined (24/2/2026, 14:27:05) to include more comprehensive state resets and a `navigate(location.pathname, { replace: true })` to force a full re-render and re-initialization of the page and its virtualization when rows change.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html` (20/2/2026, 12:16:22):**
    *   Updated `shaka.js` player version from `4-7-1` to `4.13.8`.
    *   Added `ima3.js` from Google IMA SDK.
    *   Cleaned up commented-out script tags.
    *   Updated meta tags related to viewport for disabling zoom (`user-scalable=0`).
    *   Changed `<link rel='stylesheet' href='./src/fonts.scss' />` to use `.scss` extension instead of `.css`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (20/2/2026, 12:16:57):**
    *   Minor import formatting changes (e.g., multiline imports).
    *   Added a `<ExtraAppModals/>` component.
    *   Included a `<VideoSpinner />` component.
    *   Updated `BrowserRouter` with `future={{v7_startTransition: true, v7_relativeSplatPath: true}}`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (20/2/2026, 13:13:26):**
    *   Added `history.go(-1); webapis.avplay.stop();` to the `document.hidden` event handler.
    *   Included console logs for debugging Tizen platform interactions and key registrations.
    *   Expanded `initExtraSamsungKeys` to register more keys: `ColorF0Red`, `ColorF1Green`, `ColorF2Yellow`, `ColorF3Blue`, and numeric keys (`0` through `9`), `ChannelDown`, `ChannelUp`.
    *   Improved `launchAppTizen` and `openSamsungStore` with more robust error handling and logging.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerLoader.jsx` (20/2/2026, 18:52:39):**
    *   Revised advertisement URL handling in `getStreamData`:
        *   Old approach commented out, which stripped query parameters from `vmapUrl`.
        *   New approach introduced `build3catVmapUrl` and `getVmapParamsPlatform` to replace macros in the `vmapUrl` with real platform-specific values. This indicates a more dynamic and platform-aware ad integration.
    *   Added `window.BufferingIndicator.show()` and `window.BufferingIndicator.hide()` calls in the initial `useEffect` for better buffering indication.
    *   Added calls to `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.disable()` and `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.enable()` around player lifecycle events, suggesting improved screen saver management during playback.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (20/2/2026, 18:58:23 - 20/2/2026, 19:25:16):**
    *   Introduced `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` in `onKeyDownHandler` (20/2/2026, 19:05:58), then removed `e.stopPropagation()` (20/2/2026, 19:15:17), and re-added `e.stopPropagation()` at the end of the handler (20/2/2026, 19:21:43). This shows iteration on event handling for keyboard input to prevent default browser behavior and control event propagation across different Smart TV platforms. The final version appears to `preventDefault` at the start and `stopPropagation` at the end for common keys.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss` (23/2/2026, 12:40:42):**
    *   Added `woff` font definitions for "Bw 3Cat" and "Roboto" fonts, indicating a broader support for font formats.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 17:26:19 - 23/2/2026, 17:27:28):**
    *   Removed `setInterval` call from the initial `useEffect` (23/2/2026, 17:27:28) that was refreshing local favorites every 3 seconds. This suggests a change in how frequently favorite status is checked or a removal of a debugging interval.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 19:07:16):**
    *   Added `icLinkExterior` import and logic for displaying an external link icon when `isExternal` and `platformLogo` are present.
    *   Modified `navFixedFocusShape` to include `external-content` class for external items.
    *   Adjusted the title rendering logic in `infoContainer` to filter `null` values and join with ' - '.
    *   Added `useExternalEmission` hook and related logic for `isLiveExternal` and `whiteTagText` to display "EN DIRECTE" or "upcoming" tags for external live content.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx` (24/2/2026, 10:52:48 - 24/2/2026, 14:18:59):**
    *   **Virtualization Logic Refinement:**
        *   Initial version of `handleRowNavigation` didn't reset `visibleRows` and `accumulatedTop` on wrapping around from the last row to the first.
        *   Improved `handleRowNavigation` (24/2/2026, 10:56:20) to reset these states when navigating from the last row back to the first (`currentRow === totalRows - 1`).
        *   Refined the `setVisibleRows` update to prevent unnecessary re-renders if the `newVisibleRows` array is identical to `prev`.
        *   The `useEffect` that saves virtualization state now depends on `currentRow` and `rowXTranslatePos`, ensuring state is saved correctly after navigation.
        *   A `syncVirtualizationWithData` function was added to the returned object (24/2/2026, 14:18:41), implying that the `Page` component would now be responsible for calling it to synchronize the virtualization state with data changes. This function was then removed in the very next commit (24/2/2026, 14:18:59), indicating rapid iteration or an abandoned approach for external synchronization.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (24/2/2026, 20:47:55):**
    *   Minor code formatting changes.
    *   `generateShowAllElements` now registers/unregisters focus actions, ensuring proper focus management for the "Show All" button.

### General Patterns & Recurring Elements:

*   **Focus Management and Navigation:** Heavy emphasis on focus management (e.g., `data-nav-fixed-focus-shape`, `data-group`, `data-block-focus-right/left/down/up`, `data-on-lost-left-action`, `data-on-receive-focus-action`, `nav.focusById`). This suggests a complex UI requiring precise control over keyboard/remote navigation.
*   **Live Content Handling:** The `Page` component frequently updates logic related to "Now Playing" content and live stream data. This includes fetching `ApiGetNowPlayingSelector` and `ApiGetNowPlaying`, and using `setInterval` to refresh live data, which is a critical feature for a Smart TV application. The `checkTimeFrame` function is a core part of this, managing the display of live programs based on start/end dates.
*   **Virtualization:** The `useVirtualizedRows` hook is consistently used, along with its associated states (`visibleRows`, `accumulatedTranslate`, `currentRow`). There is an ongoing effort to ensure virtualization state is correctly maintained and reset, especially when the underlying `pageData` (number of rows) changes dynamically. This is crucial for performance in large lists.
*   **Context API Usage:** The application makes extensive use of React's Context API (e.g., `AuthContext`, `OptionsContext`, `SettingsContext`, `SitecatalystContext`, `HighlightContext`, `CapabilitiesContext`, `VirtualizationContext`), indicating a centralized state management approach for application-wide concerns.
*   **Platform-Specific Logic:** There are clear conditional checks for `window.AppGlobal.platform` (e.g., 'hbbtv', 'webos', 'tizen') in multiple files (`Page`, `App.jsx`, `generic.js`, `tizen.js`), highlighting the need for platform-specific adaptations in a Smart TV environment.
*   **Debugging and Logging:** Frequent use of `console.log` and `ajsrConsole.log` (a custom console logger) indicates active debugging during development. Some `setInterval` calls in `useEffect`s (like the one added to `Page` to simulate row removal) are explicitly for testing dynamic data scenarios.
*   **User Experience (UX) Considerations:** Features like `ExitAppModal`, `UserModal`, `GeoRestrictionPlayerModal`, buffering indicators, and screen saver management (`window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.enable/disable`) show attention to a robust and user-friendly experience on Smart TV platforms.
*   **Ad Integration:** The `playerLoader.jsx` changes show a more sophisticated ad integration with macro replacement for `vmapUrl`, indicating custom ad server logic.
*   **Styling:** SCSS is used for styling, with separate stylesheets for general (`styles.scss`) and kid-specific (`styles.kids.scss`) interfaces.

## 9:50:30
The log details changes across several JavaScript (JSX) and SCSS files within the `3cat_smarttv` project, primarily focusing on page rendering, live content refreshing, and keyboard navigation.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx`**
    *   **20/2/2026, 12:11:57 - 12:12:08**: Initial changes involve modifying the `live_refresh_interval` from `3000` to `10000` (or `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`) within the `Page` component. This suggests an adjustment to how frequently live content is refreshed.
    *   **20/2/2026, 12:27:43**: The `live_refresh_interval` is explicitly set back to `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000;`.
    *   **23/2/2026, 15:47:34**: `live_refresh_interval` is temporarily hardcoded to `3000` for testing purposes, indicated by the comment `//settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000;`.
    *   **23/2/2026, 16:47:49 - 16:48:23**: The `live_refresh_interval` is reverted to use `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000;`.
    *   **23/2/2026, 16:50:06 - 17:13:02**: No functional changes are observed in these timestamps, indicating potential re-saves or minor non-functional changes.
    *   **23/2/2026, 17:31:09**: In `checkTimeFrame`, the `setPageData` call is commented out (`/*setPageData(...)*/`) and `homeDataRef.current` is directly updated with filtered children.
    *   **23/2/2026, 17:32:44**: The `checkTimeFrame` function is significantly refactored. Instead of directly calling `setPageData`, it now constructs `newData` and only calls `setPageData` (and `setIsLoading(false)`, `hasRefreshed.current = true`) if `!hasRefreshed.current`. This indicates an optimization to avoid unnecessary re-renders on subsequent live data refreshes.
    *   **23/2/2026, 19:01:47**: The `checkTimeFrame` function's logic for setting `pageData` is reverted, uncommenting the direct `setPageData` call and commenting out the `newData` and `hasRefreshed.current` logic.
    *   **23/2/2026, 19:09:03**: The `checkTimeFrame` function undergoes a substantial rewrite to optimize live content updates.
        *   It now tracks `livePositionsToUpdate` using a `Set` to identify which rows need re-rendering.
        *   The logic for updating `homeDataRef.current` and its children (including slider items) is changed to ensure immutability by creating new objects/arrays (`{ ...homeDataRef.current.children[position], ...}`, `newSliderChildren`).
        *   It introduces a conditional render: a full `setPageData` on the *first* refresh (`!hasRefreshed.current`), and a more granular update (`setPageData(prev => { ... })`) for *subsequent* refreshes, specifically updating only the `liveRows` children to prevent unnecessary re-renders of static rows.
    *   **23/2/2026, 23:31:18**: A `console.log(homeDataRef.current);` is added in `checkTimeFrame`.
    *   **23/2/2026, 23:33:59**: An `setInterval` is added within `checkTimeFrame` to force `setPageData` every 2 seconds, which contradicts the previous optimization for granular updates. This appears to be a debugging or testing change.
    *   **23/2/2026, 23:36:38**: The `setInterval` added previously is removed, reverting to the single `setPageData` call after `checkTimeFrame` completes.
    *   **23/2/2026, 23:39:38**: `live_refresh_interval` is temporarily hardcoded to `2000` for testing.
    *   **23/2/2026, 23:43:50 - 24/2/2026, 0:00:58**: `live_refresh_interval` is reverted to `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000;`. No other significant changes.
    *   **24/2/2026, 0:04:01**: The `checkTimeFrame` function's logic for updating `pageData` is refined. It now explicitly checks if `prev.children === newChildren` to prevent re-renders if the array reference hasn't changed.
    *   **24/2/2026, 0:06:46**: Another refactor in `checkTimeFrame`: the `newChildren` array for `setPageData` is created, and the `isSame` comparison is re-introduced, along with a `hasRefreshed.current` flag for initial vs. subsequent renders.
    *   **24/2/2026, 0:08:59 - 0:14:17**: Refinement of the `checkTimeFrame` logic. The `hasRefreshed.current` flag is used to differentiate between the initial render and subsequent live updates. For subsequent updates, it checks if `prev.children` is deeply identical to `newChildren` to avoid unnecessary re-renders. `live_refresh_interval` is hardcoded to `1000`.
    *   **24/2/2026, 12:55:28**: In `checkTimeFrame`, the `setPageData` call now has a conditional branch: if `isLoading` is true, it sets `pageData` with filtered children, otherwise it calls `filterChildren` and then sets `pageData`.
    *   **24/2/2026, 12:56:38 - 13:00:39**: The `checkTimeFrame` function is further modified to filter out `item` at `index 3` from the `c` array (which represents filtered children) before calling `setPageData`. This indicates specific item removal logic, likely for testing or a temporary display adjustment.
    *   **24/2/2026, 13:03:18**: The `homeDataRef.current` is updated with the filtered children (`c`) before being used to set `pageData`.
    *   **24/2/2026, 13:07:23 - 13:07:41**: The problematic item removal logic (index 3) is now wrapped in a `setTimeout` of 1ms, and later increased to `20000` (20 seconds), suggesting an attempt to defer the removal or test a dynamic content change. The `live_refresh_interval` is hardcoded to `6000000`.
    *   **24/2/2026, 13:10:49 - 13:10:59**: File formatting changes (e.g., semicolons, string quotes) are prominent. The `setTimeout` for removing an item after 20 seconds is present. `live_refresh_interval` is still `6000000`.
    *   **24/2/2026, 13:34:57**: A new ref `prevChildrenCount` is introduced. The `checkTimeFrame` function now includes logic to detect changes in the number of children (`rowsChanged`). If `rowsChanged` is true, it resets `accumulatedTop`, `accumulatedTranslate`, `currentRow`, and `visibleRows` for virtualization. The `setTimeout` for removing the item at index 3 is still present.
    *   **24/2/2026, 13:38:16 - 13:41:46**: Minor adjustments in `checkTimeFrame` related to state updates and `setTimeout`. The item removal at index 3 is now conditional on `hasRefreshed.current` being true. The virtualization reset logic when `rowsChanged` is true is simplified to `resetVirtualization()` in `useVirtualizedRows`.
    *   **24/2/2026, 13:43:58 - 14:06:51**: `live_refresh_interval` is reverted to `10000`. The logic for resetting virtualization is further streamlined. If `rowsChanged`, it now calls `resetVirtualization()` and `removeVirtualizationState(location.pathname)`. A `syncVirtualizationWithData` function is added to the return of `useVirtualizedRows` but not used in `page/index.jsx` yet. The `setInterval` for removing elements is removed from `checkTimeFrame` and moved to a separate `useEffect` with a 10-second interval, creating `fakeEntries` to simulate live data updates and an item removal at index 3.
    *   **24/2/2026, 14:07:27**: The `syncVirtualizationWithData` function is removed from the `useVirtualizedRows` import. The logic for dealing with `rowsChanged` now directly performs `resetVirtualization(); removeVirtualizationState(location.pathname);`.
    *   **24/2/2026, 14:15:20 - 14:15:26**: `syncVirtualizationWithData` is briefly re-added to `useVirtualizedRows` import, then removed again. The `checkTimeFrame` function still includes the logic for resetting virtualization, removing virtualization state, resetting fixed focus, setting `isLoading` to true, and navigating to the current path if `rowsChanged`.
    *   **24/2/2026, 14:19:35 - 14:44:26**: Consistent re-application of the logic to reset all page states (`resetVirtualization`, `removeVirtualizationState`, `resetFixedFocus`, `setPageData(null)`, `setIsLoading(true)`) and navigate to the current path if the number of children (`pageData.children.length`) changes. This suggests a robust attempt to handle dynamic changes in the number of rows which might break virtualization or focus. The hardcoded `newChildren.splice(3, 1)` (item removal) is commented out/removed. The `live_refresh_interval` is set to `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000;`.
    *   **24/2/2026, 20:49:15 - 20:50:12**: `live_refresh_interval` is temporarily set to `1000` and then reverted to `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000;`. The logic for handling `rowsChanged` by resetting virtualization and navigating remains.

2.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html`**
    *   **20/2/2026, 12:16:22**: A minor change from `shaka-4-7-1.js` to `shaka.4.13.8.js` in the player library import.

3.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx`**
    *   **20/2/2026, 12:16:57**: No significant functional changes in this specific log entry, but it defines the main application structure, routing, context providers, and debug functionalities.

4.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js`**
    *   **20/2/2026, 13:13:26**: The `initAppTizen` function's `visibilitychange` event listener now attempts to pause/stop the player (`webapis.avplay.stop()`) when the app is hidden, and play when resumed. It also adds a listener for `evExitApplication` to gracefully exit the Tizen application. This indicates platform-specific optimizations for app lifecycle and player management on Tizen devices.

5.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerLoader.jsx`**
    *   **20/2/2026, 18:52:39**: Updates related to player functionality:
        *   Introduced `setSubtitlesStyles` and `removeSubtitlesStyles` for dynamic subtitle styling based on user options.
        *   Modified ad VMAP URL handling from simple query stripping to a `build3catVmapUrl` function for macro replacement, indicating more sophisticated ad integration.
        *   Added `window.BufferingIndicator.show()` and `hide()` calls around player initialization/cleanup.
        *   Added `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.disable()` and `enable()` calls around player lifecycle, suggesting screen saver management during playback.

6.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js`**
    *   **20/2/2026, 18:58:23**: Keyboard navigation handling for SmartTV platforms. Includes a `onKeyDownHandler` to manage various key codes (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, ENTER, BACK, ESCAPE, PLAY, PAUSE, STOP, FFWD, REWIND). It specifically includes platform-specific key handling for WebOS and Tizen, and a general case for other platforms.
    *   **20/2/2026, 19:05:58 - 19:25:16**: The `onKeyDownHandler` is updated to include `e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation();` which indicates a change in event handling to prevent default browser actions and stop event propagation more consistently. The `e.stopPropagation()` call is moved outside the switch block.

7.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss`**
    *   **23/2/2026, 12:40:42**: Updates font imports for "Bw 3Cat" to include `.woff` formats in addition to existing `.ttf` formats. This improves cross-browser compatibility and potentially loading performance.

8.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx`**
    *   **23/2/2026, 17:26:19 - 17:27:28**: The `useEffect` that calls `refresh_LOCAL_FavoritesList()` is changed to run only once on mount, removing the `setInterval` that refreshed favorites every 3 seconds. This implies a change in how frequently local favorite status is updated.

9.  **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx`**
    *   **23/2/2026, 19:07:16**: No significant functional changes detected, mainly minor stylistic adjustments or re-saves.

10. **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx`**
    *   **24/2/2026, 10:52:48 - 12:54:17**: Significant refactoring of the `handleRowNavigation` useCallback.
        *   The logic for updating `visibleRows` is modified to always recalculate the window based on `newCurrentRow`, ensuring the visible rows are appropriate for the current focused row.
        *   A new mechanism for adjusting `accumulatedTop` based on whether the visible window is moving up or down is introduced, providing more precise scroll positioning.
        *   The "wrap around" functionality for navigation (going from last row to first row when pressing 'down') is implemented, and vice-versa when going up from the first row.
    *   **24/2/2026, 14:14:06 - 14:18:59**: `syncVirtualizationWithData` is added to the return value of the hook but not internally defined or used in the provided code snippets. This indicates an intention for `Page` component to potentially use this to manage virtualization state during dynamic content changes. The existing logic for navigation and state updates remains consistent.

11. **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx`**
    *   **24/2/2026, 20:47:55**: No significant functional changes, appears to be a re-save or minor non-functional changes.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Live Content Refreshing**: A consistent pattern across `page/index.jsx` is the handling of live content data (`checkTimeFrame`, `refreshLives`, `nowPlayingSelectorTimmerRef`). There are repeated attempts to optimize the `setPageData` call within `checkTimeFrame` to prevent unnecessary re-renders, especially when only specific live rows change. This indicates a focus on performance for dynamic live content. The `live_refresh_interval` variable is frequently modified or reverted, suggesting ongoing tuning of the live data update frequency.
*   **Virtualization Management**: The `useVirtualizedRows` hook is central to managing row rendering and state (`visibleRows`, `accumulatedTranslate`, `accumulatedTop`, `currentRow`). Changes in `page/index.jsx` frequently interact with this hook's `resetVirtualization` and `removeVirtualizationState` functions, particularly when the structure or number of rows changes (`rowsChanged` condition). This highlights a critical challenge in dynamic UIs: ensuring virtualization state remains consistent after data updates.
*   **Platform-Specific Logic**: The `platform` directory (e.g., `tizen.js`, `generic.js`) shows code tailored for different Smart TV environments (Tizen, WebOS, HbbTV). This includes handling key events, player lifecycle, and screen saver management, indicating a multi-platform development approach.
*   **Focus Management**: The `nav.fixedFocus.isNavigating` flag and `nav.focusById` calls appear across `page/index.jsx` and `generic.js`, emphasizing the importance of predictable UI focus in Smart TV applications.
*   **Debugging and Testing**: Several code snippets, especially in `page/index.jsx` (e.g., hardcoded `live_refresh_interval`, `setTimeout` for item removal, `console.log` statements), seem to be temporary additions for debugging or testing dynamic behavior like row additions/removals and live data updates. These often get reverted or adjusted in subsequent commits.
*   **Immutability and State Management**: There's a recurring effort, especially in `page/index.jsx`'s `checkTimeFrame` function, to ensure that state updates (like `homeDataRef.current` modifications) are done immutably to trigger React's re-rendering mechanism correctly and efficiently.

## 10:50:25
The provided log details changes across multiple files, primarily focusing on the `Page` component in a React application, `index.html`, and a `useVirtualizedRows` hook, along with platform-specific Tizen and generic keyboard navigation code.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (20/2/2026, 12:11:57 - 24/2/2026, 20:50:12):** This file undergoes the most frequent and significant changes.
    *   **Live Refresh Interval:** Initially set to `3000` (then commented out to `10000`), it was later explicitly set to `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000` (20/2/2026, 12:27:43). There were brief instances where it was explicitly set to `3000` or `2000` for testing, and even `6000000` (24/2/2026, 13:07:41) before reverting to `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000` (24/2/2026, 14:44:26).
    *   **State Management & Data Updates:**
        *   The `checkTimeFrame` function, responsible for updating live content, saw numerous adjustments.
        *   Early changes involved directly calling `setPageData` within `checkTimeFrame` to update the UI (20/2/2026, 12:11:57).
        *   A temporary commented-out block was introduced, suggesting an alternative approach to update `pageData` only if `!hasRefreshed.current` and directly updating `homeDataRef.current` otherwise (23/2/2026, 19:01:47). This indicated a shift towards optimizing re-renders for live data updates.
        *   Further refinements in `checkTimeFrame` (23/2/2026, 19:09:03) introduced a `livePositionsToUpdate` Set for selective updates and a more robust check to prevent unnecessary re-renders when `pageData` hasn't truly changed.
    *   **Content Filtering Logic:**
        *   Within `checkTimeFrame`, there were attempts to directly manipulate `homeDataRef.current.children` for testing purposes (e.g., `c = c.filter((_, index) => index !== 3);` to remove an item at index 3), especially around timestamps 24/2/2026, 12:57:22 to 24/2/2026, 14:17:47. These were later commented out or removed (24/2/2026, 14:36:17).
        *   The filtering logic within `checkTimeFrame` was also adjusted to handle changes in row count and reset virtualization state accordingly (24/2/2026, 13:34:57, 24/2/2026, 14:24:54, 24/2/2026, 14:39:42).
    *   **`useEffect` for Live Data Interval:** A `useEffect` hook was introduced to simulate live data updates by periodically modifying `homeDataRef.current` and calling `checkTimeFrame` (24/2/2026, 13:40:08). This was later removed, indicating it was likely a testing mechanism (24/2/2026, 13:40:13, 24/2/2026, 14:17:47).
    *   **Dependencies in `useVirtualizedRows`:** The `useVirtualizedRows` hook's dependencies were slightly modified (e.g., adding/removing `syncVirtualizationWithData`).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html` (20/2/2026, 12:16:22):** This file shows an update to the Shaka Player library, changing from `shaka-4-7-1.js` to `shaka.4.13.8.js`. It also includes new `script` tags for `underscore.js`, `visitorAPI.min.js`, `omniture.js`, `comscore.min.js`, `springstreams.min.js`, and `ima3.js`, indicating integration with various analytics, ad, and utility libraries. Commented-out lines suggest potential prior or alternative implementations for some scripts.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (20/2/2026, 12:16:57):** This update primarily details the application's routing and context providers. No direct code changes are visible in the provided snippet beyond the initial state. It imports various components, contexts, and utilities, setting up the main application structure. It also includes debug console initialization and build information display.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (20/2/2026, 13:13:26):** This file defines platform-specific functionalities for Tizen devices. Key changes include:
    *   Logging device information (`device.model`, `device.manufacturer`).
    *   Event listeners for `visibilitychange` (pausing/playing player, going back history, stopping avplay) and `evExitApplication` (exiting the application).
    *   Network state change listener to dispatch `evNetworkDisconnected`/`evNetworkConnected` events.
    *   Functions for managing screen saver (`enableScreenSaver`, `disableScreenSaver`) and registering extra Samsung TV remote keys.
    *   Functions `launchAppTizen` and `openSamsungStore` for managing app launches and store interactions.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerLoader.jsx` (20/2/2026, 18:52:39):** This file manages the video player's loading and configuration.
    *   **Ad Tag URL Handling:** The logic for `vmapUrl` (video ad tag URL) was updated. It moved from stripping query parameters from the URL to a new approach that uses `build3catVmapUrl` and `getVmapParamsPlatform` to dynamically replace macros with real values, improving ad integration.
    *   **Subtitle Styling:** Functions `setSubtitlesStyles` and `removeSubtitlesStyles` were added to dynamically apply CSS classes to the `cueContainer` based on user preferences for font size, background color, and position.
    *   **Screen Saver and Buffering:** Added `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.disable()` and `window.BufferingIndicator.show()` on component mount, and corresponding `hide()` and `enable()` on cleanup.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (20/2/2026, 18:58:23 - 20/2/2026, 19:25:16):** This file handles generic keyboard navigation for Smart TVs.
    *   **Event Handling:** Initially, `e.preventDefault()` was commented out, then enabled (20/2/2026, 19:05:58), then `e.stopPropagation()` was commented out (20/2/2026, 19:15:17), and finally both `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` were explicitly used (20/2/2026, 19:21:43), with `e.stopPropagation()` moved to the end of the handler. This indicates an iterative refinement of event flow control to prevent default browser actions and stop event propagation.
    *   **Player Key Handling:** A check `if (PLAYER_KEYS.has(keyCode) && (!window.AppGlobal.Player || !window.AppGlobal.Player.isReady))` was added to ignore player-related key presses if the player is not ready.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss` (23/2/2026, 12:40:42):** This file defines font-faces. It specifies various weights and styles for "Bw 3Cat" and "Roboto" fonts, including `truetype` and `woff` formats. The body uses "Bw 3Cat" as the primary font.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 17:26:19 - 23/2/2026, 17:27:28):** A minor change in this file removed an `setInterval` call (`setInterval(() => { refresh_LOCAL_FavoritesList(); }, 3000);`) from the initial `useEffect`, indicating a change in how the local favorites list is refreshed or a removal of an auto-refresh mechanism.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 19:07:16):** This file defines a component for displaying live items on the home screen. It was added or significantly updated, including:
    *   Memoization for `imgData`, `channelLogo`, `percentage`, and `mediaType`.
    *   Integration of `useExternalEmission` hook.
    *   Focus action registration and unregistration.
    *   Conditional rendering for external content (platform logos, live/upcoming tags).
    *   Progress bar for live content.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx` (24/2/2026, 10:52:48 - 24/2/2026, 14:18:59):** This hook for virtualized rows received updates:
    *   **Row Navigation Logic:** The `handleRowNavigation` callback was refined to correctly handle wrapping when navigating down from the last row to the first, and to adjust `accumulatedTop` only when the visible window's start changes (24/2/2026, 10:56:20).
    *   **`syncVirtualizationWithData` removal:** The `syncVirtualizationWithData` function was added to the return object (24/2/2026, 14:18:41) and then removed shortly after (24/2/2026, 14:18:59), suggesting it was either a temporary or an unused export. Its purpose was likely to explicitly sync virtualization state when underlying data changed.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (24/2/2026, 20:47:55):** This component was updated to include `LiveItemHome` and `LastDayItem` as valid `RowElement` types, and adds new conditions for `showAll` elements and external rows.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **20/2/2026:** Initial significant updates to `index.jsx` of the `Page` component, `index.html` (Shaka player and new libraries), `App.jsx` (overall structure), `tizen.js` (platform-specific event handling), and `playerLoader.jsx` (ad tag URL handling, subtitles, screensaver). This date appears to be a major development push.
*   **23/2/2026:** Continued iterative changes to `index.jsx` of the `Page` component, specifically refining the `checkTimeFrame` function and the logic for updating `pageData` and `homeDataRef.current`. The `btnFavoriteMemory/index.jsx` also saw a minor cleanup. The `liveItemHome` component was introduced.
*   **24/2/2026:** Further intensive development on `index.jsx` of the `Page` component, experimenting with live refresh intervals, conditional data updates, and virtualization state management. The `useVirtualizedRows` hook was also refined to handle row navigation and state synchronization more robustly.

**Patterns/Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focus on Live Content Refresh:** A major recurring theme across the `Page` component and related files is the continuous refinement of how live content data (`ApiGetNowPlaying`, `ApiGetNowPlayingSelector`) is fetched, merged, filtered, and displayed. This includes logic to refresh live streams at intervals, update content within existing rows, and handle cases where live content might appear or disappear.
*   **Virtualization Optimization:** The `useVirtualizedRows` hook and its integration in the `Page` component indicate a strong focus on optimizing performance for pages with many rows, especially regarding memory and rendering. Changes include saving/restoring scroll state, resetting virtualization on navigation, and adjusting visible rows efficiently.
*   **Platform-Specific Adaptations:** There's clear evidence of code designed for specific platforms (Tizen, WebOS, HBBTV) in `tizen.js` and `generic.js`, particularly concerning keyboard event handling and player actions.
*   **State Management Complexity:** The `Page` component uses a combination of `useState` and `useRef` for managing UI and data states, with `homeDataRef.current` being frequently updated. There are attempts to optimize re-renders by checking for data equality before setting state.
*   **Modality and User Experience:** References to `UserModal`, `GenericErrorModal`, `ExitAppModal`, and checks for `window.isUserModalVisible` suggest a sophisticated modal system and considerations for user interaction flow, especially around exiting the application or handling authentication.
*   **Ad and Analytics Integration:** The updates to `index.html` and `playerLoader.jsx` show active integration with various third-party services for advertising (IMA SDK) and analytics (Omniture, Comscore, VisitorAPI), indicating a commercial and data-driven aspect of the application.
*   **Font Management:** The `fonts.scss` file demonstrates custom font integration, ensuring a consistent visual brand identity.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Many changes, especially in `index.jsx` and `generic.js`, show a pattern of small, iterative adjustments and debugging, often involving temporary code (like the `setInterval` in `Page` component's `useEffect`) or commented-out sections.
