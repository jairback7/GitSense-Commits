# Activity Summary for 1/2/2026

## 3:11:46
The log details recent development activities across a Smart TV application, focusing on styling, platform-specific keyboard navigation, and consent management. All recorded changes occurred on January 30, 2026, indicating a concentrated period of updates.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\styles.scss` (30/1/2026, 9:04:15):** This file defines the visual layout and styles for a `.page_view` and a `.bottom-gradient` element. The `.page_view` is absolutely positioned, covers a 1920x1080px area, and includes a background image (`3cat_red-bg_1920x270.png`) and a `.rankingText` with specific font styling. The `.bottom-gradient` is a fixed overlay with a `mask_1080.png` background. This appears to be a foundational style definition without subsequent modifications in the log.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (Multiple timestamps: 11:38:08, 11:38:42, 11:53:37, 12:29:17, 12:29:26):**
    *   **Initial setup (11:38:08):** Established core keyboard navigation for Smart TVs. It sets up `window.AppGlobal.KeyMemory` to track key combinations for specific actions (e.g., enabling/disabling ads via "123" or "321" key sequences). The `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartTV` function handles common navigation keys (arrows, enter, back) and numeric keys, dispatching custom events for navigation and handling player-related keys (play, pause, stop, rewind, fast-forward) differently based on platform (`webos`, `tizen`, or generic). Initially, WebOS and Tizen player controls used `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller`.
    *   **Player action standardization (11:53:37):** A `VK_PLAY_PAUSE` case was introduced for WebOS to toggle play/pause using `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions`.
    *   **Further standardization (12:29:17):** Play, pause, and stop actions for WebOS were updated to consistently use `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` instead of `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller`, aligning with other platforms. Rewind and Fast Forward actions continued to use `dispatchRewindEvent()` and `dispatchFastForwardEvent()`.
    *   The timestamps 11:38:42 and 12:29:26 appear to be saves without functional code changes.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\keycodes.js` (30/1/2026, 11:54:49):** This file defines key code constants specific to the HbbTV platform. It maps standard remote control keys (navigation, color buttons, media controls, numeric keys) to their corresponding hexadecimal or decimal values, with graceful fallbacks if `window.KeyEvent` is unavailable. This is a static configuration file.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\hbbtv.js` (Multiple timestamps: 11:55:42, 11:55:54, 11:56:04, 12:29:39, 12:33:41):**
    *   **Initial setup (11:55:42):** Implemented HbbTV application initialization, including handling `evExitApplication` to destroy the app. The `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartHbbTV` function registers keys specific to HbbTV (color keys, navigation, VCR controls) using `app.privateData.keyset`. Media playback controls initially used `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller`.
    *   **Play/Pause inclusion (11:56:04):** `VK_PLAY_PAUSE` was added to the destructured KeyCodes import, enabling its use in the key processing logic for `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.togglePlayPause()`.
    *   **Player action standardization (12:29:39):** All media playback actions (play, pause, stop, rewind, fast forward) within the HbbTV key handler were updated to use `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` instead of `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller`, mirroring the changes made in `generic.js`.
    *   **Seek event dispatching (12:33:41):** Rewind and fast-forward actions were refactored to dispatch `customSeekKeyDown` events via `dispatchRewindEvent()` and `dispatchFastForwardEvent()`, rather than directly calling `Player.Actions.seek...`, further standardizing event handling.
    *   The timestamp 11:55:54 appears to be a save without functional code changes.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\contexts\didomiContext.jsx` (Multiple timestamps: 12:20:04, 12:20:41, 12:21:34):**
    *   **Consent management integration (12:20:04):** Introduced a React context (`DidomiContext`) and provider (`DidomiProvider`) to manage Didomi consent management platform (CMP) integration. It handles the display and interaction with Didomi notices and preferences, including timed delays for SDK loading and notice display. Custom `keydown` handling is implemented for back/exit keys to manage Didomi modals.
    *   **Modal addition (12:21:34):** The `ExtraAppModals` component was added to the render output of the `DidomiProvider`, indicating an expansion of modal capabilities.
    *   The timestamp 12:20:41 appears to be a save without functional code changes.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (30/1/2026, 12:29:46):** This file provides comprehensive Tizen platform integration. It initializes Tizen applications, retrieves device information, manages application lifecycle events (visibility changes, exit), and monitors network connectivity. Crucially, it registers extended Samsung TV remote keys (media, color, numeric, channel) and includes functionalities for screen saver control, launching other Tizen applications, and opening the Samsung App Store.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Platform-Specific Development:** A clear separation of concerns for different Smart TV platforms (`generic`, `WebOS`, `Tizen`, `HbbTV`) is evident, particularly in how keyboard inputs and application lifecycles are managed.
*   **Keyboard Navigation and Media Control:** A significant focus is on handling remote control inputs for navigation (up, down, left, right, enter, back) and media playback (play, pause, stop, rewind, fast forward) across various platforms.
*   **Player API Standardization:** A recurring pattern is the refactoring of media player control calls from `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` and the introduction of `dispatchSeekEvent` for consistency across `generic.js` and `hbbtv.js`.
*   **Custom Event Dispatching:** The use of `CustomEvent` (`customKeyDown`, `customNavigation`, `customSeekKeyDown`, `evExitApplication`) is a common pattern for inter-component communication and event handling.
*   **Consent Management Integration:** The `didomiContext.jsx` file highlights the integration of a third-party consent management solution (Didomi), including its lifecycle management and custom key handling.
*   **Application Lifecycle Management:** Several files (`generic.js`, `hbbtv.js`, `tizen.js`, `didomiContext.jsx`) implement logic for handling application exit, visibility changes, and modal states.
*   **Extensive Logging:** The frequent use of `ajsrConsole.log` and `console.log/warn/error` indicates a strong emphasis on debugging and tracing application behavior across different platforms.
*   **Timestamp Clustering:** All changes occurred on the same day, suggesting a dedicated effort towards feature implementation, refactoring, and platform integration, possibly in preparation for a release or a major update.
