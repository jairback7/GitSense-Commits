    *   This initial entry defines core styles for a page view, including a full-screen background image (`3cat_red-bg_1920x270.png`), an absolutely positioned "ranking text," and a fixed-position bottom gradient with a `mask_1080.png` image.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js`** (Significant changes around 30/1/2026, 11:53:37 and 2/2/2026, 17:08:44):
    *   **Keyboard Navigation & Platform Keys**: Initialized key memory for combination detection and defined specific key combinations (e.g., ad enabling/disabling via "979899").
    *   **Platform-Specific Key Handling**: Expanded WebOS key handling to include `VK_PLAY_PAUSE` (30/1/2026, 11:53:37).
    *   **Player Action Standardization**: Refactored player control calls from `Player.Controller.action()` to `Player.Actions.action()` within WebOS and Tizen specific key handling blocks (30/1/2026, 12:29:17).
    *   **Event Handling Control**: Added `e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation();` to the global `onKeyDownHandler` to prevent default browser behavior and stop event propagation, ensuring the application has full control over key presses (2/2/2026, 17:08:44).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\keycodes.js`** (Timestamp: 30/1/2026, 11:54:49):
    *   This file provides a comprehensive mapping of HbbTV key codes to symbolic `VK_` constants, including navigation, colored buttons, media playback, and numeric keys, with fallbacks for `window.KeyEvent` properties.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\hbbtv.js`** (Significant changes around 30/1/2026, 12:29:39 and 30/1/2026, 12:33:41):
    *   **Key Code Definitions**: Updated destructuring to include `VK_PLAY_PAUSE` (30/1/2026, 11:56:04).
    *   **Player Action Standardization**: Similar to `generic.js`, changed player control calls from `Player.Controller.action()` to `Player.Actions.action()` for play, pause, and stop (30/1/2026, 12:29:39).
    *   **Seek Event Dispatching**: Rewind and fast-forward actions were updated to dispatch `customSeekKeyDown` events instead of directly calling player controller seek methods, indicating a move towards event-driven player control (30/1/2026, 12:33:41).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\contexts\didomiContext.jsx`** (Numerous changes, key ones around 2/2/2026, 10:28:16; 2/2/2026, 12:09:49; 2/2/2026, 12:38:36):
    *   **Modal Integration**: Initially, `ExtraAppModals` was imported and rendered; later renamed to `AppModals` (30/1/2026, 12:21:34 and 2/2/2026, 10:25:12).
    *   **Network State Integration**: Introduced `handleNetworkDisconnected` and `handleNetworkConnected` functions to react to custom network events (`evNetworkDisconnected`, `evNetworkConnected`). These handlers manage the visibility of the Didomi notice and associated elements, and re-attach keydown listeners on network reconnection (2/2/2026, 10:28:16 onwards).
    *   **Conditional Modal Rendering**: The `AppModals` component's rendering logic was modified to depend on `displayingDidomiNotice.current` or `didomiHostElement.current`, meaning it's shown when the Didomi UI is active (2/2/2026, 12:09:49, 2/2/2026, 12:17:32).
    *   **Improved Cleanup**: The `closeDidomi` function was enhanced to remove network event listeners and explicitly reset Didomi-related state variables, ensuring a cleaner teardown (2/2/2026, 12:38:36).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js`** (Significant changes around 2/2/2026, 10:24:00 and 2/2/2026, 13:29:59):
    *   **Network Listener Refinement**: `initNetworkStateListener` was significantly refactored, moving from direct modal calls to dispatching generic `evNetworkDisconnected` and `evNetworkConnected` events, standardizing network state communication (2/2/2026, 10:24:00).
    *   **Player Pause on Visibility**: The `visibilitychange` event listener was updated to explicitly pause the player (`window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.pause()`) when the application goes into the background (2/2/2026, 13:29:59).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerController.js`** (Significant changes around 2/2/2026, 13:36:14 and 2/2/2026, 13:56:25):
    *   **Network Event Handling**: Introduced `initNetworkHandlers` to pause the player on network disconnection and play it on reconnection (if not in an ad break). This was later refactored to use instance methods for better cleanup and introduced a `hasNetwork` state (2/2/2026, 13:36:14, 2/2/2026, 13:41:16, 2/2/2026, 13:56:25).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerOverlay.jsx`** (Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 13:57:54):
    *   **Conditional Controls Visibility**: The `showPlayerControls` function was updated to only show player controls if there is an active network connection, leveraging the `playerController.hasNetworkConnection()` method.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\mediaTitle\styles.scss`** (Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 16:33:36):
    *   This entry defines a consistent visual style for media titles, including specific font sizes and weights for different title types (e.g., program titles, live streams, menu details, external content).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\portraitItem\styles.scss`** (Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 16:39:57):
    *   Defines styles for portrait-oriented media items, particularly focusing on visual feedback for focused and hovered states with box-shadows and borders. It also includes styling for various tags and external platform logos.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\keyboard\styles.scss`** (Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 17:09:25):
    *   Enhanced the styling of keyboard keys by adding a `:hover` effect that mirrors the `.focused` state, providing clearer visual feedback on interaction.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx`** (Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 16:31:34):
    *   This component displays detailed media information. Updates include refining logic for displaying episode/season counts, handling content expiration dates, and dynamically generating titles and descriptions based on content type (live, VOD, audio, upcoming events, external). It also removes a "Publication" feature as per a Jira task.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\index.jsx`** (Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 17:36:09):
    *   Manages the application's multi-level side menu. Updates involve adjusting how `window.__isEntry` is determined (briefly set by `isMenuVisible`) for handling initial menu state and navigation.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\onboarding\usersScreen\index.jsx`** (Numerous changes, key ones around 2/2/2026, 18:04:11; 2/2/2026, 18:05:33; 2/2/2026, 18:14:59):
    *   **Back Button Behavior**: The `onBackClick` for `PageHead` was updated to always trigger `window.AppGlobal.Actions.openExitAppModal` (2/2/2026, 18:04:11).
    *   **Entry Point Flags**: The `window.__isEntry` flag, used for determining app entry, was changed multiple times, including being hardcoded to `true` (2/2/2026, 18:05:33, 18:10:38) and later replaced by a new `window.__foceEntry` flag managed with a `useEffect` hook (2/2/2026, 18:14:59).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\utils\goBackHistory.js`** (Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 18:15:16):
    *   This utility now explicitly checks `window.__isEntry` or `window.__foceEntry` to decide whether to call a provided callback function (e.g., exit app) or navigate back in history, particularly handling player-related menus.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx`** (Numerous changes, key ones around 2/2/2026, 18:51:35; 2/2/2026, 18:52:39; 2/2/2026, 18:54:07):
    *   **Exit Modal Logic**: The `openExitAppModal` function saw several modifications, initially closing the application menu before attempting to show the exit modal (2/2/2026, 18:51:35). It was then updated to also manage focus (`window.AppMenu.manageFocused?.()`) before opening the modal (2/2/2026, 18:52:39), and finally simplified to directly set modal state flags without explicit menu management (2/2/2026, 18:54:07).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\webos\webos.js`** (Significant changes around 2/2/2026, 14:12:47):
    *   **Enhanced Network State Listener**: The `initNetworkStateListener` was improved to dynamically determine the correct connection manager service based on the WebOS SDK version (`com.webos.service.connectionmanager` vs. `com.palm.connectionmanager`). It also now tracks the `lastNetworkState` to prevent redundant event dispatches and dispatches generic `evNetworkConnected`/`evNetworkDisconnected` events (2/2/2026, 14:12:47).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\3cat_pro\gateway\js\app.js`** (Timestamp: 2/2/2026, 14:16:27):
    *   This WebOS gateway file contains logic to determine the connection manager based on SDK version and to handle network availability for redirecting to the main application URL or displaying a network error message. It also sets up a back button listener when offline.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Standardized Player Actions**: A consistent effort to shift direct player controller calls (`Player.Controller`) to a more abstract `Player.Actions` interface is evident across `generic.js`, `hbbtv.js`, and `playerOverlay.jsx`.
*   **Centralized Network Event Handling**: The introduction and widespread use of custom `evNetworkDisconnected` and `evNetworkConnected` events demonstrate a pattern of standardizing how network state changes are communicated and reacted to throughout the application, from platform-specific integrations (`tizen.js`, `webos.js`) to core contexts (`didomiContext.jsx`) and player components (`playerController.js`, `playerOverlay.jsx`, `appModals/index.jsx`).
*   **Modal and Focus Management**: There's a clear focus on refining the behavior of modals, especially the Didomi consent notice and the exit application modal. This includes careful management of focus when modals open and close (`nav.storedFocus`, `nav.focusById`, `nav.disable/enable/release`), and the introduction of `window.isUserModalVisible` to control global UI state.
*   **Entry Point and Back Navigation Logic**: The repeated modifications and introduction of flags like `window.__isEntry` and `window.__foceEntry` in `usersScreen/index.jsx` and `goBackHistory.js` indicate an ongoing effort to define and control the application's entry points and the corresponding back navigation experience across different scenarios.
*   **Debugging and Configuration**: The `App.jsx` file highlights the presence of extensive debug configurations (`window.appConfig.test_app.showBuildInfo`, `showUserConfig`, `showModalsDebug`) that allow developers to inspect various aspects of the application, such as environment variables, user agent, app version, build details, platform, and player information.

**Sensitive Information Handling:**
The `build_templates/tizen/3cat_pro/config.xml` file was noted to contain a URL in its metadata. Following instructions, specific details of this URL have not been included in the summary, focusing instead on its role as a Tizen configuration file and the privileges it declares.

    *   Initial styling for the main application view (`.page_view`) and a bottom gradient, setting background image, positioning, and dimensions.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (Multiple changes from 30/1/2026, 11:38:08 to 2/2/2026, 17:08:44):**
    *   **Initial Setup**: Establishes global key memory for combination inputs and sets up keyboard navigation with event throttling, dispatching custom `customKeyDown` and `customNavigation` events. It defines common Smart TV key handlers (navigation, enter, back, numbers) and platform-specific player controls for WebOS, Tizen, and non-HbbTV platforms.
    *   **Refactoring Player Actions (30/1/2026, 11:53:37 & 30/1/2026, 12:29:17)**: Introduces handling for `VK_PLAY_PAUSE` on WebOS and begins refactoring player control calls from `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` for consistency.
    *   **Event Handling Refinement (2/2/2026, 17:08:44)**: Adds `e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation();` to the `onKeyDownHandler` to ensure complete control over keyboard events, preventing default browser behavior.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\keycodes.js` (30/1/2026, 11:54:49):**
    *   Standardizes HbbTV key codes by defining a `KeyCodes` object with fallback hexadecimal values, covering navigation, colored buttons, media controls, and numeric keys.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\hbbtv.js` (Multiple changes from 30/1/2026, 11:55:42 to 30/1/2026, 12:33:41):**
    *   **Initial Setup**: Implements HbbTV-specific app initialization and keyboard navigation, including `evExitApplication` listener and registration of keyset masks.
    *   **Player Actions Refactoring (30/1/2026, 12:29:39 & 30/1/2026, 12:33:41)**: Aligns player control calls to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` (similar to `generic.js`) and further refactors seek operations (`seekMinus10Seconds`, `seekPlus10Seconds`) to dispatch custom `customSeekKeyDown` events, centralizing seek logic.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\contexts\didomiContext.jsx` (Extensive changes from 30/1/2026, 12:20:04 to 2/2/2026, 12:38:36):**
    *   **Initial Setup**: Establishes the Didomi consent management context, managing the visibility of consent notices and preferences, and handling keydown events for back/exit. It can trigger an `ExitAppModal`.
    *   **Integration of `AppModals` (30/1/2026, 12:21:34)**: Integrates the `AppModals` component directly into the `DidomiContext.Provider` for centralized modal handling. The rendering condition for `AppModals` saw several changes, oscillating between `displayingDidomiNotice.current`, `window.displayingDidomi`, and `didomiHostElement.current` as the trigger.
    *   **Network Event Handling (2/2/2026, 10:28:16 to 2/2/2026, 11:34:47)**: Introduces and refines `handleNetworkDisconnected` and `handleNetworkConnected` functions to respond to custom network events (`evNetworkDisconnected`, `evNetworkConnected`). These handlers now manage the display of the Didomi notice and re-attach keydown listeners as needed.
    *   **Consent State Management (2/2/2026, 12:27:25 & 2/2/2026, 12:32:31 & 2/2/2026, 12:38:36)**: Explicitly sets `didomiHostElement.current = false;` in various conditions when consent is not collected or the notice is not displayed, ensuring `AppModals` are not rendered unnecessarily. The `closeDidomi` function is enhanced to remove network event listeners, making cleanup more robust.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (Multiple changes from 30/1/2026, 12:29:46 to 2/2/2026, 13:31:01):**
    *   **Initial Setup**: Implements Tizen-specific app initialization, `visibilitychange` handling (pausing/playing media), `evExitApplication` for app termination, and registration of extra Samsung remote keys.
    *   **Network Listener Refinement (2/2/2026, 10:19:43 to 2/2/2026, 10:24:00)**: Initially comments out and then fully reinstates `initNetworkStateListener`. The function is improved to dispatch generic `evNetworkDisconnected` and `evNetworkConnected` custom events instead of direct modal calls, streamlining network event propagation across the app.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerController.js` (Multiple changes from 2/2/2026, 13:35:20 to 2/2/2026, 13:56:25):**
    *   **Initial Setup**: Establishes the player controller, integrating various analytics plugins and player handlers (Shaka, Avplay, Html, Html5). Includes logic for autoplay and ad handling, with `onEnded` specifically ignoring events during ad breaks.
    *   **Network State Integration (2/2/2026, 13:36:14 to 2/2/2026, 13:41:16)**: Introduces `initNetworkHandlers()` to pause the player on `evNetworkDisconnected` and play on `evNetworkConnected` (conditionally, if not in an ad break). This logic is refined to store handlers as class properties for proper cleanup.
    *   **Network Connection Flag (2/2/2026, 13:56:25)**: Adds a `hasNetwork` property and a `hasNetworkConnection()` method to provide a direct way to query the network status within the player controller.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerOverlay.jsx` (Multiple changes from 2/2/2026, 13:48:48 to 2/2/2026, 13:59:00):**
    *   **Initial Setup**: Defines the React component for the player UI overlay, managing player states (loading, playing, paused, error), rendering controls for live and VOD content, and handling navigation for episodes. It integrates `AdOverlayWrapper` and various information components.
    *   **Network-Aware Controls (2/2/2026, 13:57:54)**: Adds a check `if (!playerController.hasNetworkConnection()) return` to `showPlayerControls`, preventing the display of controls if there is no active network connection.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\3cat_pro\gateway\js\app.js` (2/2/2026, 14:16:27):**
    *   A WebOS gateway script that determines the appropriate connection manager based on the SDK version and redirects to either a development or production URL (`smartv-dev.3cat.website` or `smartv-pro.3cat.website`) upon internet connection. It also handles the 'Back' key to exit the application if there's no internet.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\webos\webos.js` (Multiple changes from 2/2/2026, 14:07:27 to 2/2/2026, 14:13:52):**
    *   **Initial Setup**: Implements WebOS-specific app lifecycle events (`webOSLaunch`, `webOSRelaunch`, `visibilitychange`, `evExitApplication`) and app/store launching functionalities.
    *   **Dynamic Network Manager (2/2/2026, 14:12:47)**: Enhances `initNetworkStateListener` to dynamically select the correct connection manager service (`com.webos.service.connectionmanager` or `com.palm.connectionmanager`) based on the WebOS SDK version, ensuring compatibility across different OS versions. It also prevents duplicate network state events.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx` (2/2/2026, 16:31:34):**
    *   Provides a flexible React component to display grouped media information (e.g., tags, title, description, age rating, duration) with logic for live/VOD content and external platforms.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\mediaTitle\styles.scss` (2/2/2026, 16:33:36):**
    *   Defines CSS for media titles, including font properties, text overflow, and specific styles for different contexts (e.g., program titles, live streams, menu details).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\portraitItem\styles.scss` (2/2/2026, 16:39:57):**
    *   Styles for portrait-oriented media items, including their size, positioning, and visual feedback for focused and hover states using shadows and borders.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\keyboard\styles.scss` (2/2/2026, 16:56:08 & 2/2/2026, 17:09:25):**
    *   **Initial Styling**: Styles for a virtual keyboard, defining layout, key appearance, and states (small, medium, large, focused).
    *   **Hover Feedback (2/2/2026, 17:09:25)**: Adds a `:hover` style for keyboard keys, mirroring the `focused` state's visual feedback, to improve user interaction.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\index.jsx` (2/2/2026, 17:36:09 & 2/2/2026, 17:36:22):**
    *   **Initial Setup**: React component for the main application side menu, handling 1st and 2nd level menu visibility, user-specific menus, and navigation. It dynamically attaches a "Search" option to the menu.
    *   **Entry Point Flag (2/2/2026, 17:36:22)**: Introduces `window.__isEntry = isMenuVisible;` in a `useEffect` hook, likely to track if the menu is visible at an app's entry point.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\onboarding\usersScreen\index.jsx` (Extensive changes from 2/2/2026, 17:45:11 to 2/2/2026, 18:14:59):**
    *   **Initial Setup**: Displays user selection options, including logged-in users, a "Super3" kids profile, and "Add User." Includes a conditional "Continue as Guest" button for HbbTV.
    *   **Back Button Logic (2/2/2026, 18:04:11 to 2/2/2026, 18:14:59)**: The `onBackClick` behavior for `PageHead` is made to consistently open the exit app modal. The `window.__isEntry` flag's control is repeatedly toggled between reflecting `location.state` and being hardcoded `true`, indicating ongoing development or testing of entry point behavior. Finally, it's replaced by a new global `window.__foceEntry` flag to manage forced entry states.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\utils\goBackHistory.js` (2/2/2026, 18:15:16):**
    *   **Enhanced Logic**: Modifies the global `goBackHistory` utility. It now checks for `window.__isEntry` or `window.__foceEntry` (along with specific pathnames) to trigger a callback (usually showing an exit modal) instead of standard history navigation. Special handling for the media player's audio/subtitle menu is also added.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (Multiple changes from 2/2/2026, 18:50:50 to 2/2/2026, 19:14:36):**
    *   **Initial Setup**: Sets up the main application, including React Router, numerous context providers, platform initialization, and debug tools. Defines global actions for opening exit and logout modals.
    *   **Exit Modal Logic Refinement (2/2/2026, 18:51:35 to 2/2/2026, 19:14:36)**: The `openExitAppModal` function undergoes several modifications. Initially, it calls `window.AppMenu?.exitMenu?.()` and sets up modal visibility and focus. It then briefly disables the core modal logic (18:51:35), reinstates it with added `window.AppMenu.manageFocused?.()` (18:52:39), simplifies it again by removing menu/focus calls (18:54:07), and finally re-adds `window.AppMenu?.exitMenu?.()` (19:14:36). This shows an iterative process to define how the main menu and focus should behave when the exit modal is triggered.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\tizen\3cat_pro\config.xml` (3/2/2026, 13:24:24):**
    *   Updates the Tizen widget version to `3.4.6`. Adds `tizen:metadata` for `use.preview` to point to a production discovery feed URL.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Platform-Specific Adaptations**: A strong recurring theme is the adaptation of functionalities (keyboard input, player controls, network detection, app lifecycle) to different Smart TV platforms (WebOS, Tizen, HbbTV) using conditional logic and platform-specific APIs.
*   **Centralized Global Actions**: The frequent use of `window.AppGlobal.Actions` for functions like `openExitAppModal`, `play`, `pause`, and `togglePlayPause` indicates a pattern of centralizing application-wide actions for easier access and management across components.
*   **Player Control Refinement**: There is a clear evolution in player control, moving from direct `Controller` calls to `Actions` and then to custom event dispatches for certain operations, suggesting an effort to decouple and standardize player interactions.
*   **Network Event Integration**: The introduction and continuous refinement of network state listeners across multiple files (`playerController.js`, `tizen.js`, `webos.js`, `didomiContext.jsx`) highlight a focus on making the application robust and responsive to connectivity changes. Custom events (`evNetworkDisconnected`, `evNetworkConnected`) are a common mechanism for propagating these changes.
*   **Modal and Dialog Management**: `DidomiContext` and `AppModals` are central to handling user interactions with consent notices and various application modals, with frequent updates to their display conditions, event listeners, and cleanup procedures.
*   **Entry Point and Navigation Logic**: The repeated modifications to `window.__isEntry` and the introduction of `window.__foceEntry`, along with changes in `goBackHistory` and `App.jsx`, indicate an active effort to control the application's back button behavior and exit flow, especially when the app starts or is in a "forced entry" state.
*   **Debugging and Logging**: Consistent use of `ajsrConsole.log` and `window.appConfig.test_app.show...` flags points to ongoing development, debugging, and the ability to toggle debug information and features.
