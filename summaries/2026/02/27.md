# Activity Summary for 27/2/2026

## 2:39:05
`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (20/2/2026, 12:11:57 - 24/2/2026, 14:44:26)

This file, a React component named `Page`, underwent extensive modifications related to data fetching, live content refreshing, and rendering logic.

**Key Changes:**

*   **Live Refresh Interval:** The `live_refresh_interval` variable's initialization was frequently changed, toggling between a hardcoded `3000`, `10000`, `2000`, `6000000` (likely for testing a very long interval), and `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`. This suggests ongoing experimentation or adjustments to how frequently live content is updated.
*   **Data Handling in `checkTimeFrame`:** Several changes were made to how `pageData` is updated within the `checkTimeFrame` function, which handles live stream data.
    *   Initially, `setPageData` was called directly with the new filtered children.
    *   Later, a `newData` variable was introduced, and `homeDataRef.current` was updated directly with `newData`. A conditional `if (!hasRefreshed.current)` was added to call `setPageData` only once, setting `hasRefreshed.current` to true afterwards. This indicates an attempt to optimize re-renders by preventing `setPageData` calls on every interval after the initial load.
    *   Further modifications (23/2/2026, 19:09:03) refined this logic: `checkTimeFrame` now identifies `livePositionsToUpdate` using a `Set` for efficiency. The first render (`!hasRefreshed.current`) still triggers a full `setPageData`. Subsequent updates (`livePositionsToUpdate.size > 0`) use `setPageData(prev => ...)` to only update the modified rows by returning new references for changed `children` array elements while keeping existing ones, aiming for more granular re-renders.
    *   Temporary debug-related changes (23/2/2026, 23:33:59, 24/2/2026, 13:00:39, etc.) included wrapping `setPageData` in a `setInterval` and filtering out the item at index 3, which were subsequently removed.
    *   A significant change (24/2/2026, 14:17:47 onwards) modified the `setPageData` call within `checkTimeFrame` for when `rowsChanged` (i.e., the number of children changes). Instead of just returning a new state, it now triggers a full reset of virtualization state (`resetVirtualization()`, `removeVirtualizationState(location.pathname)`, `resetFixedFocus()`, `setPageData(null)`, `setIsLoading(true)`, etc.) and navigates to the current path with `replace: true`. This drastic action suggests that changes in row count require a complete re-initialization of the page's UI state to prevent rendering issues.
*   **`useEffect` for Simulation:** A `useEffect` hook was temporarily added (24/2/2026, 13:40:08) to simulate live data changes and row removals every 10 seconds. This block was later removed (24/2/2026, 14:15:20) and then re-added and removed multiple times in quick succession, indicating active debugging and testing of dynamic content removal and virtualization resetting.
*   **Virtualization Context Integration:** A `syncVirtualizationWithData` function was temporarily referenced in `useVirtualizedRows` (24/2/2026, 14:07:27) but later removed from the destructuring (24/2/2026, 14:15:20), implying a brief consideration and then reversion of a specific virtualization synchronization approach in this component.
*   **Cleanup on `onReset`:** The `onReset` function, called on `evChangeUser`, consistently clears various state and ref values, and removes the "FAVORITES" slug from `AppGlobal.ApiMemory.functions`.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html` (20/2/2026, 12:16:22)

This update involved minor changes to comments and script imports.
*   A commented out `<script src='http://192.168.1.90:8080/target/target-script-min.js'></script>` was added, suggesting development/debugging tooling.
*   There were commented-out `shaka` player script imports (e.g., `shaka-4-7-1.js` and `vtt.js`) and a new import `<script type='text/javascript' src='/libs/player/shaka.4.13.8.js'></script>` was introduced, indicating an upgrade or specific version selection for the Shaka Player library.
*   An `ima3.js` script from `imasdk.googleapis.com` was added, likely for integrating Google Interactive Media Ads.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (20/2/2026, 12:16:57)

This log shows a single comprehensive change to the `App.jsx` file.
*   **Context Providers:** Added `DidomiProvider`, `ParentalControlProvider`, `SettingsContextProvider`, `TextsContextProvider`, and `HighlightProvider` to the application's context tree. This significantly expands the global state and functionality available to components.
*   **Route Structure:** Expanded the `Routes` definition, adding new `PublicRoute` and `PrivateRoute` wrappers, and including routes for `Collection`, `Directes`, `AllCatalog`, `AccessibleContent`, `LastDays`, `PlayerLoader`, `DetailPage`, `GridPage`, `SearchPage`, and `Configuration`. This indicates a major restructuring or expansion of the application's navigation and view components.
*   **Debug and Global Functions:** Introduced `InitDevConsole` for enhanced logging, and attached `openExitAppModal` and `openCloseSessionModal` to `window.AppGlobal.Actions`. Also added `BuildInfo`, `DebugConfigPane`, `DebugSessionSettingsPane`, and `DebugModalsLauncher` components, suggesting improved debugging capabilities and build information display.
*   **Platform Initialization:** The `Platform.initPlatform()` and `Platform.initKeyboard()` calls are now explicitly within an `InitApp` function triggered by a `useEffect` hook.
*   **Modal Management:** Introduced `exitModal` state and associated handlers (`openExitAppModal`, `closeExitAppModal`, `handleCancel`, `handleOk`) for managing different types of exit/logout modals.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (20/2/2026, 13:13:26)

This log reflects a single large update to Tizen-specific platform logic.
*   **Visibility Change Handling:** Enhanced the `visibilitychange` event listener to pause/stop `window.AppGlobal.Player` when the app is hidden and play when resumed, along with a `history.go(-1)` on hide.
*   **Exit Application:** Added a new `evExitApplication` event listener that calls `tizen.application.getCurrentApplication().exit()` to properly exit the Tizen application.
*   **Network State Listener:** Implemented `initNetworkStateListener` using `webapis.network.addNetworkStateChangeListener` to dispatch `evNetworkDisconnected` and `evNetworkConnected` events based on network state changes.
*   **Screen Saver Management:** Introduced `initScreenSaverHelpers` to control the Tizen screen saver (enable/disable) and update `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.status`.
*   **Keyboard Key Registration:** `initExtraSamsungKeys` was added to register additional Samsung TV remote keys like media control keys (Play, Pause, Stop, Rewind, FastForward) and color buttons.
*   **App Launch and Store Integration:** New functions `launchAppTizen` and `openSamsungStore` were added to handle launching other Tizen applications or opening the Samsung TV app store.
*   **Debugging Enhancements:** Several `ajsrConsole.log` calls were added throughout the file, along with `debugTizenAppCommon` function, indicating an increase in logging for Tizen-specific debugging.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerLoader.jsx` (20/2/2026, 18:52:39)

This file saw a single change, primarily focused on player advertisement logic and subtitle styling.
*   **Ad Tag URL Handling:** The logic for `_currentVODAdTagUrl` was significantly updated. The previous version used `stripQuery` to remove query parameters. The new version introduces `build3catVmapUrl` (and `getVmapParamsPlatform`) to dynamically build the VMAP URL by replacing macros (`__platform__`, `__gdpr__`, etc.) with real values, ensuring proper ad targeting. This is conditional on `window.config.ads.enabled`.
*   **Subtitle Styling:** Functions `setSubtitlesStyles` and `removeSubtitlesStyles` were added to dynamically apply CSS classes to the `cueContainer` based on user `optionsProvider` settings for font size, background color, and position. `setSubtitlesStyles()` is called directly, indicating an immediate application of styles.
*   **Screen Saver Interaction:** Added calls to `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.disable()` on component mount and `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.enable()` on cleanup, indicating screen saver management during player activity.
*   **Buffering Indicator:** `window.BufferingIndicator.show()` and `window.BufferingIndicator.hide()` calls were added to manage a buffering indicator.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (20/2/2026, 18:58:23 - 20/2/2026, 19:25:16)

This file handles generic Smart TV keyboard navigation. The changes primarily involved refining event handling for `keydown`.
*   **Event Propagation Control:** The lines `e.preventDefault();` and `e.stopPropagation();` were initially commented out (20/2/2026, 18:58:23), then uncommented together (20/2/2026, 19:05:58). In a subsequent commit (20/2/2026, 19:15:17), `e.stopPropagation()` was commented out while `e.preventDefault()` remained active. Finally, `e.stopPropagation()` was moved to the end of the `onKeyDownHandler` function (20/2/2026, 19:21:43) and then removed entirely (20/2/2026, 19:25:16). This iterative change demonstrates a careful adjustment of event handling, likely to balance preventing default browser actions with allowing event propagation when desired for certain platform-specific or application-level listeners.
*   **Player Key Handling:** Added a conditional check `if (PLAYER_KEYS.has(keyCode) && (!window.AppGlobal.Player || !window.AppGlobal.Player.isReady))` to ignore player-related key presses if the player is not ready, preventing unintended actions.
*   **Debug Key '3':** The handling for key code `51` (number '3') was added to update an element with `id='buildNumber'` to display the build number.
*   **Consolidation of Key Handling:** Player-related key presses (Play, Pause, Stop, Rewind, Fast Forward) were added to the `PLAYER_KEYS` set and also explicitly handled within the generic `switch (keyCode)` block, in addition to platform-specific blocks (WebOS, Tizen).

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss` (23/2/2026, 12:40:42)

This commit introduced a new font-face definition.
*   **New Font Format:** Added WOFF format font files for "Bw 3Cat" to complement the existing TTF files, improving cross-browser and cross-platform compatibility and potentially load times. This includes `bw3cat-black.woff`, `bw3cat-bold.woff`, `bw3cat-medium.woff`, `bw3cat-regular.woff`, and `bw3cat-thin.woff`.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 17:26:19 - 23/2/2026, 17:27:28)

Minor changes related to favorite status.
*   **Interval Removal:** An `setInterval` that called `refresh_LOCAL_FavoritesList` every 3 seconds was removed from the initial `useEffect` hook. The `refresh_LOCAL_FavoritesList` is now called only once on mount. This likely optimizes performance by reducing unnecessary frequent checks for favorite status.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 19:07:16)

This change added new attributes and improved image handling.
*   **`navFixedFocusShape`:** Introduced a dynamic `navFixedFocusShape` attribute for focus management, which adapts based on whether the content is external.
*   **`generateImageDataFromLiveChannelInHome_v2`:** Changed the image data generation function to `generateImageDataFromLiveChannelInHome_v2`, indicating an update to how live channel images are processed.
*   **External Content Display:** Added new UI elements (`platform-footer`, `platform-logo`, `platform-icon`, `tag live`, `tag upcoming`) to better display external live content, including platform logos and status tags (EN DIRECTE / UPCOMING).
*   **Audio Icon:** Included an `AudioIcon` component to indicate audio-only media types.
*   **Title Filtering:** The `title` display logic was updated to filter out `null` values more robustly when joining parts of the title.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx` (24/2/2026, 10:52:48 - 24/2/2026, 14:18:59)

This hook saw significant refactoring for row virtualization.
*   **State Initialization from Saved State:** The hook now initializes `visibleRows`, `accumulatedTranslate`, `accumulatedTop`, `currentRow`, `idToFocus`, and `rowXTranslatePos` from `savedState` fetched from `useVirtualizationContext`. This ensures that the scroll position and visible rows are preserved across navigations if saved.
*   **Improved Row Navigation Logic:** The `handleRowNavigation` callback was extensively refined.
    *   Previously, the logic for calculating `newVisibleRows` and `accumulatedTop` was less explicit about window adjustment.
    *   Changes (24/2/2026, 10:56:20) introduced explicit logic for adjusting `accumulatedTop` only when the `start` index of the visible window changes, and a more robust wrap-around logic (`newCurrentRow = 0; setAccumulatedTranslate(0); setAccumulatedTop(0); setVisibleRows([...Array(windowSize).keys()]); setCurrentRow(0); return;`) when navigating down from the last row.
*   **Virtualization State Management:**
    *   The `resetVirtualization` function was updated to save the initial state to the `virtualizationContext` using `setPageState`.
    *   The `saveVirtualization` function now explicitly saves `idToFocus` and `rowXTranslatePos`.
    *   A `removeVirtualizationState` function was added and is called when the `pageId` changes, ensuring that old page states are cleaned up.
*   **`syncVirtualizationWithData`:** A new function `syncVirtualizationWithData` was added to the return object (24/2/2026, 14:18:41) but was then removed (24/2/2026, 14:18:59). This suggests an abandoned attempt to introduce a more granular synchronization method for virtualization states when underlying data changes.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (24/2/2026, 20:47:55)

This component, responsible for rendering generic rows, received updates for new item types and focus management.
*   **New Row Element Mappings:** Updated the `getRowElement` and `getShowAllElementsFocusShape` functions to include new row types: `SQUARE_MINI`, `INLINE`, `FEATURED`, `HERO`, `LIVE_TV`, and `LAST_DAYS`. This suggests the introduction of new visual styles and content arrangements.
*   **Dynamic `showAll` Button:** The `generateShowAllElements` function was refactored to dynamically create a "Show All" button, incorporating `useEffect` for focus registration/unregistration.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Added logic for `FEATURED` and `HERO` row types to potentially slice `rowItems` or push `rowData` as the sole item, indicating specialized rendering for these prominent row types.
*   **External Row Styling:** Introduced `isExternalRow` detection and a corresponding CSS class, suggesting visual differentiation for external content rows.
*   **Accessibility and Focus Attributes:** Added numerous `data-` attributes for enhanced focus management and navigation, including `data-nav-strategy`, `data-nav-fixed-focus-shape`, `data-block-focus-right`, `data-group-restore-last-focused`, `data-on-lost-left-action`, and `data-on-receive-focus-action`.
*   **Audio Icon Support:** Added `showAudioIcon={item.media_type === 'audio'}` prop to `RowElement` to conditionally display an audio icon.

**Overall Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focus Management:** A strong recurring theme is the meticulous management of focus (`nav.fixedFocus.isNavigating`, `nav.move.up/down/left/right`, `nav.action()`, `registerFocusAction`, `unregisterFocusAction`, `window.nav.focusById`). This indicates a focus-driven UI, common in Smart TV applications where remote control navigation is primary.
*   **Virtualization:** The `useVirtualizedRows` hook and its integration in `index.jsx` show a commitment to optimizing rendering performance by virtualizing rows, especially crucial for content-heavy pages. The changes also show a progression in refining how virtualization state is saved, restored, and reset in response to data changes.
*   **Live Data Refresh:** The logic for `refreshLives` and `checkTimeFrame` in `index.jsx` is central, continuously updating live content based on API calls and applying time-based filtering. The frequent adjustments to `live_refresh_interval` and `setPageData` calls highlight ongoing fine-tuning of this real-time update mechanism.
*   **Platform-Specific Adaptations:** The `generic.js` and `tizen.js` files demonstrate the need for platform-specific keyboard handling, screen saver controls, and application lifecycle management, characteristic of developing for diverse Smart TV operating systems.
*   **Debugging and Logging:** Frequent additions and removals of `console.log` statements and the use of `ajsrConsole` indicate an active development and debugging environment, with a strong emphasis on understanding application behavior across different components and platforms.
*   **Context API Usage:** The `App.jsx` file heavily uses React's Context API (e.g., `AuthContext`, `OptionsContext`, `SettingsContext`, `SitecatalystContext`, `CapabilitiesContext`, `VirtualizationContext`, `HighlightContext`), centralizing state management and making various application-wide configurations and data accessible to components.
*   **Dynamic UI Elements:** The ability to dynamically add new row types and modify their display (e.g., external content indicators, audio icons, "Show All" buttons) suggests a flexible and extensible UI architecture.

## 3:38:59
The provided log details changes across several JavaScript (JSX) and SCSS files within the `3cat_smarttv` project, focusing primarily on component logic, state management, and platform-specific behaviors.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (20/2/2026, 12:11:57 - 24/2/2026, 14:44:26):**
    *   This file, representing a `Page` component, saw a large number of iterative changes, primarily in its `checkTimeFrame` and `getHomeData` functions, and related `useEffect` hooks.
    *   **Live Refresh Interval:** Initially, `live_refresh_interval` was hardcoded to `3000`, then `10000`, and later changed to dynamically use `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`. There was a brief period where it was set to `2000` and `1000`, and even a very large `6000000` (likely for testing a static state or debugging), before reverting to `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`.
    *   **`checkTimeFrame` Logic:** Significant refactoring occurred in `checkTimeFrame` to manage the `pageData` state more efficiently.
        *   Initial versions directly set `pageData` after filtering children and merging live data.
        *   Later changes introduced a `hasRefreshed` ref and conditional logic to prevent unnecessary re-renders on subsequent live data refreshes. It attempted to update `pageData` only if `hasRefreshed.current` was false (for the initial load), otherwise, it would directly update `homeDataRef.current`.
        *   Further modifications (23/2/2026, 19:09:03) introduced a `livePositionsToUpdate` Set and more granular state updates, attempting to only update specific "live rows" within the `pageData` to optimize rendering.
        *   Subsequent reverts (23/2/2026, 23:31:18 onwards) simplified this back to directly setting `pageData` with the full filtered data, and then introduced `setTimeout` blocks (e.g., 24/2/2026, 13:07:23) to perform actions like removing an item at index 3 after a delay (e.g., 10000ms, then 20000ms), which seems to be a debugging or testing mechanism for dynamic content changes.
        *   The `checkTimeFrame` function also saw changes to how `newChildren` were derived and how `setPageData` was called, often incorporating logic to prevent re-renders if the data hadn't truly changed, and handling `rowsChanged` scenarios by calling `resetVirtualization` and `navigate(location.pathname, { replace: true })` (e.g., 24/2/2026, 14:24:54).
    *   **`useEffect` for Mock Data (24/2/2026, 13:40:08):** A temporary `useEffect` was added to `index.jsx` that introduced a `setInterval` to periodically create `fakeEntries` and manually `splice` an item at index 3 from `homeDataRef.current.children`, then call `checkTimeFrame`. This was likely a testing mechanism for row removal and live data updates, and it was removed in subsequent commits (24/2/2026, 13:41:46).
    *   **Import Optimization:** Standardized imports from separate `import` statements to a single, grouped `import { ... } from 'react'` statement.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html` (20/2/2026, 12:16:22):**
    *   Updated Shaka Player library from `shaka-4-7-1.js` (commented out) to `shaka.4.13.8.js`.
    *   Added `ima3.js` for Google Interactive Media Ads SDK.
    *   Included a `purple-console.min.js` and `easy.qrcode.min.js` script.
    *   Added a `<div id="cueContainer"></div>` within the player setup.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (20/2/2026, 12:16:57):**
    *   Added `VideoSpinner` component.
    *   Included `App.kids.scss` stylesheet.
    *   Modified the `InitDevConsole` function to configure `ajsrConsole` with specific colors, font size, and print strategy.
    *   Added new debug info for `Player`, `Media type`, and `Ads` to the `BuildInfo` component.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (20/2/2026, 13:13:26):**
    *   Added `ajsrConsole.log` calls for Tizen-specific debugging information.
    *   Enhanced `initAppTizen` to specifically log device model and manufacturer using `tizen.systeminfo.getPropertyValue('BUILD')`.
    *   Updated the `visibilitychange` event listener to include `webapis.avplay.stop()` when the app is hidden on Tizen.
    *   Modified `initScreenSaverHelpers` to use `ajsrConsole.log` for status updates and update a debug element (`debug-info-screensaver`).
    *   Extended `initExtraSamsungKeys` to register more keys like `ColorF0Red`, `ColorF1Green`, `ColorF2Yellow`, `ColorF3Blue`, numeric keys ('0'-'9'), and `ChannelDown`/`ChannelUp`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerLoader.jsx` (20/2/2026, 18:52:39):**
    *   Added `removeSubtitlesStyles` and `setSubtitlesStyles` functions to manage CSS classes on `cueContainer` based on `optionsProvider` for subtitle styling (font size, background color, position).
    *   Updated ad VMAP URL handling logic: changed from `stripQuery` to `build3catVmapUrl` and `getVmapParamsPlatform` to replace macros with real values for dynamic ad tag generation.
    *   Included logic to `show()` and `hide()` a global `window.BufferingIndicator`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (20/2/2026, 18:58:23 - 20/2/2026, 19:25:16):**
    *   Focused on `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartTV` function.
    *   Initially, `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` were commented out in the `onKeyDownHandler` (18:58:23).
    *   These were explicitly added back in subsequent commits (19:05:58), then `e.stopPropagation()` was commented out again (19:15:17), and finally re-added (19:21:43), before being removed completely from the `onKeyDownHandler` in the last log entries for this file (19:25:16). This indicates experimentation with event handling behavior for key presses across different Smart TV platforms.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss` (23/2/2026, 12:40:42):**
    *   Added new `@font-face` rules for "Bw 3Cat" and "Roboto" fonts, including different weights and styles, using both `.ttf` and `.woff` formats.
    *   Set the default `body` font-family to "Bw 3Cat".

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 17:26:19 - 23/2/2026, 17:27:28):**
    *   Removed a `setInterval` that was refreshing local favorites every 3 seconds from the `useEffect` hook, streamlining favorite status updates to rely on direct actions or item changes.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 19:07:16):**
    *   Improved image data generation by using `generateImageDataFromLiveChannelInHome_v2` for better handling of live channel images.
    *   Enhanced display of external content with platform logos and an external link icon.
    *   Added logic to display "EN DIRECTE" or "UPCOMING" tags based on `isLiveExternal` and `whiteTagText` from a `useExternalEmission` hook.
    *   Adjusted title rendering for `audio` media types to include a "with presenter" text.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx` (24/2/2026, 10:52:48 - 24/2/2026, 14:18:59):**
    *   Multiple iterations refined the virtualization logic.
    *   Initially, `handleRowNavigation` updated `currentRow` and `visibleRows`, recalculating the window based on `currentRow`.
    *   Later versions (24/2/2026, 10:56:20) added explicit logic to handle "wrap-around" navigation (moving from last row to first, or vice-versa) and to adjust `accumulatedTop` only when the visible window's start index changes, aiming for smoother scrolling.
    *   A `syncVirtualizationWithData` function was intended to be passed to `Page` (24/2/2026, 14:18:41) but was then removed, indicating a change in approach or a feature that was not fully implemented or was later considered unnecessary in `useVirtualizedRows`. The parent component `index.jsx` instead directly calls `resetVirtualization()` and `removeVirtualizationState()` on row count changes.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (24/2/2026, 20:47:55):**
    *   The `getRowElement` function was updated to use a more precise `rowType` argument and removed `rowItems.length` from its parameters.
    *   Added a `LastDayItem` case to `getRowElement` for `LAST_DAYS` row type.
    *   Refined the `onFocusAction` logic for `FEATURED` and `INLINE` row types to pass `item` or `null` based on type.
    *   Improved the `ShowAllElements` component logic and `data-nav-fixed-focus-shape` attribute generation.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **React State Management:** Heavy reliance on `useState`, `useRef`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` hooks across `Page`, `PlayerLoader`, and `useVirtualizedRows` components to manage component state, side effects, and performance optimizations.
*   **Platform-Specific Logic:** Frequent checks for `window.AppGlobal.platform` (e.g., `hbbtv`, `webos`, `tizen`) to apply platform-specific behaviors, such as filtering content, handling key events, or interacting with native APIs (e.g., `tizen.systeminfo`, `webapis.network`). This is a strong recurring pattern demonstrating a cross-platform application.
*   **Live Content Refresh:** A core recurring theme is the implementation and refinement of live content refreshing. This involves:
    *   Fetching "Now Playing" data (`ApiGetNowPlaying`, `ApiGetNowPlayingSelector`).
    *   Merging live data into existing `pageData` (e.g., `mergeData`, `replaceItemInDirectesChildren`).
    *   Filtering out unsupported live content based on capabilities (`isLiveSupportedRef`).
    *   Using `setInterval` for periodic refreshes with a configurable `live_refresh_interval`.
    *   Optimizing re-renders by detecting data changes in arrays or using refs to store data, attempting to prevent full state updates when only parts of the data change.
*   **Virtualization and Navigation:** The `useVirtualizedRows` hook, used by `Page`, is central to handling efficient rendering and navigation across large lists of rows. Changes here consistently involve managing `visibleRows`, `accumulatedTranslate`, `accumulatedTop`, `currentRow`, and saving/restoring this state. Navigation events (`customNavigation`) trigger updates to these virtualization states.
*   **Error Handling and Authentication:** API calls (`ApiHome`, `ApiContent_NO_PROMISE`) consistently include error handling that checks for "Unauthorized" or "Token expired" messages, leading to logout and redirection to authentication screens.
*   **Styling:** SCSS files (`styles.scss`, `styles.kids.scss`) are consistently used for component-specific styling, indicating a component-based styling approach with considerations for child-specific themes.
*   **Debugging and Testing Mechanisms:** Several temporary additions, like hardcoded `live_refresh_interval` values, `console.log` statements with `ajsrConsole`, and a `useEffect` with a `setInterval` to mock row removal, indicate active debugging and testing during this period. These were often reverted or refined shortly after their introduction.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (20/2/2026, 12:11:57 - 24/2/2026, 14:44:26):
This file, a React component named `Page`, undergoes extensive modifications over several days, primarily focusing on how live stream data is refreshed and how the component's state (specifically `pageData` and its `children`) is updated in response to these refreshes.

Key Changes and Patterns:
- **Live Refresh Interval:** The `live_refresh_interval` variable is frequently commented out and re-assigned, oscillating between a hardcoded `3000`, `10000`, `2000`, `1000`, and `6000000` (which is then also commented out) before settling back to `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`. This suggests active testing and tuning of the live data refresh rate.
- **`checkTimeFrame` Function:** This core function, responsible for processing live stream data and updating `homeDataRef.current`, sees several iterations of its state update logic:
    - Initially, it directly calls `setPageData` with the updated `homeDataRef.current`.
    - Later, it introduces a `hasRefreshed` ref to differentiate between the initial load and subsequent updates, attempting to only call `setPageData` for the initial render.
    - A significant change on 23/2/2026, 19:09:03, introduces a more refined update strategy. It identifies `livePositionsToUpdate` to only re-render affected rows, aiming for performance optimization by preventing unnecessary full page data updates on every live refresh. It also clones `homeDataRef.current.children` to avoid direct mutation.
    - Subsequent changes attempt various `setTimeout` mechanisms (e.g., 20 seconds, 10 seconds, 1 second) and direct filtering (e.g., `c.filter((_, index) => index !== 3)`) within the `checkTimeFrame` function, and within a new `useEffect` hook, to simulate dynamic content removal. This behavior is repeatedly added and removed or commented out, indicating testing for dynamic row manipulation and its impact on virtualization and rendering.
- **Virtualization Integration:** The component heavily relies on `useVirtualizedRows` hook. There are attempts to interact with its `resetVirtualization` and `removeVirtualizationState` functions, especially when the number of rows changes, to ensure proper rendering and focus management after data modifications. On 24/2/2026, 14:06:51, there's an attempt to pass `syncVirtualizationWithData` from the hook, though the `useVirtualizedRows` log entry shows this function isn't part of its returned values. The line `removeVirtualizationState(location.pathname);` is also frequently added back in the update logic, suggesting persistent issues or concerns with virtualization state after data changes.
- **Data Filtering:** The `filterChildren` function is consistently used to modify the children array before setting it to `pageData`, primarily to remove 'live' type children if live streaming is not supported, and to exclude specific rows based on conditions like `item.h1 === 'CANALS TEMÀTICS'` or `item.collection === 'user_row' for KID users`.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html` (20/2/2026, 12:16:22):
This file had a single update, primarily changing the Shaka Player library version from `shaka-4-7-1.js` to `shaka.4.13.8.js`, and commenting out previous Shaka Player and VTT library imports. It also updated the page title.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (20/2/2026, 12:16:57):
This file remained stable with one update, showing general application setup including routing, context providers, and debugging utilities. It initializes platform-specific features and keyboard navigation, and renders different routes based on user authentication status and HbbTV platform detection.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (20/2/2026, 13:13:26):
This file had one update. It defines Tizen-specific platform initialization functions, including getting device info, handling `visibilitychange` events (pausing/playing video, exiting app), and setting up network state listeners. It also registers extra Samsung TV remote keys for media playback and color buttons, and provides functions for launching other Tizen applications or opening the Samsung store. Debugging console logs (`ajsrConsole.log`) are prominent throughout the file.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerLoader.jsx` (20/2/2026, 18:52:39):
This file had a single update, detailing the logic for loading player streams. Key changes involve:
- **Ad Tag URL Handling:** A significant update in how VMAP ad tag URLs are processed. The previous version stripped query parameters, while the new version explicitly builds the VMAP URL by replacing macros (`__platform__`, `__gdpr__`, etc.) with real values. This indicates a more sophisticated and platform-aware ad integration.
- **Time Markers for Autoplay:** Logic was added to handle `credits` time markers. If autoplay is enabled and related content exists, a default `credits` marker is added to trigger next episode logic if one isn't already present in the stream data.
- **Screen Saver and Buffering Integration:** Integration with `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.disable/enable()` and `window.BufferingIndicator.show/hide()` to manage screen saver and buffering UI during player lifecycle.
- **Audio Stream Refresh:** `LiveAudioDataRefresh.startInterval()` is called for `LIVE_AUDIO` streams, suggesting a mechanism for periodic updates of "Now Listening" information.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (20/2/2026, 18:58:23 - 20/2/2026, 19:25:16):
This file, responsible for generic Smart TV keyboard navigation, undergoes several small, iterative changes:
- The main pattern is the repeated commenting and uncommenting of `e.preventDefault();` and `e.stopPropagation();` within the `onKeyDownHandler` function. This suggests debugging and testing related to event handling and preventing default browser/platform actions for specific key presses. It appears to settle on `e.preventDefault();` being active, but `e.stopPropagation();` is commented out. This indicates a decision to prevent default key actions but allow event bubbling for other handlers.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss` (23/2/2026, 12:40:42):
This file had a single update, which involved adding Web Open Font Format (WOFF) definitions for the "Bw 3Cat" font family, in addition to the existing TrueType Font (TTF) definitions. This aims to improve font loading compatibility and performance across different browsers and platforms. It also ensures "Bw 3Cat" is the primary font for the `body` element, with `sans-serif` as a fallback.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 17:26:19 - 23/2/2026, 17:27:28):
This file, a React component for a favorite button, had one small change. A `setInterval` call to `refresh_LOCAL_FavoritesList()` with a 3-second interval was removed from the initial `useEffect` hook. The `refresh_LOCAL_FavoritesList()` function is now only called once on component mount for `item` changes, suggesting a shift from continuous polling for favorite status to a more event-driven or initial-load approach.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 19:07:16):
This file had a single update. It updates the `LiveItemHome` component, a React memoized component. The key changes are:
- **`navFixedFocusShape` enhancement:** The `data-nav-fixed-focus-shape` attribute now dynamically includes 'external-content' class if the item is external (`isExternal` is true), allowing for distinct focus styling for external live content.
- **New attributes for external content:** Added conditional rendering for `isLiveExternal` and `whiteTagText` derived from `useExternalEmission` hook, allowing to display 'EN DIRECTE' tag or an 'upcoming' tag for external live/upcoming content.
- **Improved title rendering:** The `title` section now filters out `null` values and joins the `h1` (or `h2`) with the presenter name (for audio media) using ' - ', for a cleaner display.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx` (24/2/2026, 10:52:48 - 24/2/2026, 14:18:59):
This hook manages row virtualization and scrolling state.
- **Improved `handleRowNavigation` Logic:** The `handleRowNavigation` callback is refined across these commits. Initially, it reset `newCurrentRow` to 0 and `accumulatedTranslate`/`accumulatedTop` to 0 when navigating "down" from the last row. A significant update (24/2/2026, 10:56:20) explicitly sets `setVisibleRows([...Array(windowSize).keys()])` and `setCurrentRow(0)` for this wrap-around behavior. It also introduces logic to adjust `accumulatedTop` only when the visible window's start index changes, aiming for smoother scrolling.
- **Removal of `syncVirtualizationWithData`:** The `syncVirtualizationWithData` function is added to the return object in one commit (24/2/2026, 14:18:41) but then removed in the very next commit (24/2/2026, 14:18:59), suggesting it was either a temporary test or deemed unnecessary for the public API of the hook.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (24/2/2026, 20:47:55):
This file had a single update, improving the `GenericRow` component. Key changes include:
- **Enhanced `getRowElement` and `getShowAllElementsFocusShape`:** These helper functions are updated to handle additional `rowType` values, such as `SQUARE_MINI`, `PORTRAIT_MINI`, and `LAST_DAYS`, providing appropriate React components and focus shapes for these new row types. `LiveItemHome` is explicitly mapped for `LIVE_TV` rows.
- **Dynamic "Show All" Elements:** The `generateShowAllElements` function is refactored to explicitly manage focus actions using `registerFocusAction` and `unregisterFocusAction` hooks, ensuring proper focus behavior for the "Show All" button. It also correctly passes `data-group-restore-last-focused` and `data-block-focus-down` attributes.
- **Row Type Handling for `HERO` and `FEATURED`:** Specific logic is added to handle `FEATURED` rows (only showing the first item) and `HERO` rows (pushing `rowData` as the item if none exist), indicating special rendering requirements for these types.
- **Styling and Attributes:** More granular control over row styling is introduced with `smashingDefaults` for `paddingLeft`, `width`, `marginLeft`, and `marginRight`. Several conditional `data-block-focus` and `data-on-lost-left-action` attributes are added to `RowElement` for better navigation control.
- **Audio Icon Display:** The `showAudioIcon` prop is passed to `RowElement` based on `item.media_type === 'audio'`, suggesting visual differentiation for audio content.

**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**
- **Live Content Refresh Logic:** The most prominent recurring theme across the `index.jsx` file for the `page` view is the continuous iteration and refinement of the live content refresh mechanism. This involves:
    - **`live_refresh_interval` tuning:** Frequent changes to the refresh interval, indicating ongoing performance and responsiveness adjustments.
    - **`checkTimeFrame` modifications:** Iterative changes to how `checkTimeFrame` updates the `pageData` state, with attempts to optimize re-renders (e.g., using `hasRefreshed.current`, `livePositionsToUpdate` sets), and various debugging insertions for dynamically removing items via `setTimeout` and `splice`.
    - **`homeDataRef.current` manipulation:** The `homeDataRef.current` object is consistently mutated and then used to derive new state, often followed by `setPageData`. There's an attempt to clone it on 23/2/2026, 19:09:03, but this is later removed, suggesting that mutation of `homeDataRef.current` is a core part of the live update strategy.
- **Virtualization Management:** The `useVirtualizedRows` hook is a critical dependency, and the `Page` component frequently calls `resetVirtualization` and `removeVirtualizationState` in response to various events (menu navigation, user changes, and, in some tests, dynamic row count changes). This indicates an ongoing effort to maintain correct scroll and focus state when the underlying data structure or display changes.
- **Focus and Navigation:** The application extensively uses `nav.fixedFocus.isNavigating` and `nav.focusById` within its components and platform files, highlighting a strong emphasis on keyboard navigation and maintaining focus state in a Smart TV environment. Custom navigation events (`customNavigation`) are also a key part of this system.
- **Platform-Specific Adaptations:** Both `App.jsx` and `tizen.js` show clear adaptations for different Smart TV platforms (e.g., HbbTV, Tizen, WebOS), handling specific key codes and platform APIs, which is a consistent architectural decision.
- **Debugging and Testing:** The frequent commenting/uncommenting of code, direct state manipulations in `checkTimeFrame` (like `splice(3, 1)`), and console logs, especially around live data updates and keyboard events, suggest a rapid iteration and debugging process.
