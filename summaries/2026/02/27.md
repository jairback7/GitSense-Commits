# Activity Summary for 27/2/2026

## 2:39:05
`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (20/2/2026, 12:11:57 - 24/2/2026, 14:44:26)

This file, a React component named `Page`, underwent extensive modifications related to data fetching, live content refreshing, and rendering logic.

**Key Changes:**

*   **Live Refresh Interval:** The `live_refresh_interval` variable's initialization was frequently changed, toggling between a hardcoded `3000`, `10000`, `2000`, `6000000` (likely for testing a very long interval), and `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`. This suggests ongoing experimentation or adjustments to how frequently live content is updated.
*   **Data Handling in `checkTimeFrame`:** Several changes were made to how `pageData` is updated within the `checkTimeFrame` function, which handles live stream data.
    *   Initially, `setPageData` was called directly with the new filtered children.
    *   Later, a `newData` variable was introduced, and `homeDataRef.current` was updated directly with `newData`. A conditional `if (!hasRefreshed.current)` was added to call `setPageData` only once, setting `hasRefreshed.current` to true afterwards. This indicates an attempt to optimize re-renders by preventing `setPageData` calls on every interval after the initial load.
    *   Further modifications (23/2/2026, 19:09:03) refined this logic: `checkTimeFrame` now identifies `livePositionsToUpdate` using a `Set` for efficiency. The first render (`!hasRefreshed.current`) still triggers a full `setPageData`. Subsequent updates (`livePositionsToUpdate.size > 0`) use `setPageData(prev => ...)` to only update the modified rows by returning new references for changed `children` array elements while keeping existing ones, aiming for more granular re-renders.
    *   Temporary debug-related changes (23/2/2026, 23:33:59, 24/2/2026, 13:00:39, etc.) included wrapping `setPageData` in a `setInterval` and filtering out the item at index 3, which were subsequently removed.
    *   A significant change (24/2/2026, 14:17:47 onwards) modified the `setPageData` call within `checkTimeFrame` for when `rowsChanged` (i.e., the number of children changes). Instead of just returning a new state, it now triggers a full reset of virtualization state (`resetVirtualization()`, `removeVirtualizationState(location.pathname)`, `resetFixedFocus()`, `setPageData(null)`, `setIsLoading(true)`, etc.) and navigates to the current path with `replace: true`. This drastic action suggests that changes in row count require a complete re-initialization of the page's UI state to prevent rendering issues.
*   **`useEffect` for Simulation:** A `useEffect` hook was temporarily added (24/2/2026, 13:40:08) to simulate live data changes and row removals every 10 seconds. This block was later removed (24/2/2026, 14:15:20) and then re-added and removed multiple times in quick succession, indicating active debugging and testing of dynamic content removal and virtualization resetting.
*   **Virtualization Context Integration:** A `syncVirtualizationWithData` function was temporarily referenced in `useVirtualizedRows` (24/2/2026, 14:07:27) but later removed from the destructuring (24/2/2026, 14:15:20), implying a brief consideration and then reversion of a specific virtualization synchronization approach in this component.
*   **Cleanup on `onReset`:** The `onReset` function, called on `evChangeUser`, consistently clears various state and ref values, and removes the "FAVORITES" slug from `AppGlobal.ApiMemory.functions`.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html` (20/2/2026, 12:16:22)

This update involved minor changes to comments and script imports.
*   A commented out `<script src='http://192.168.1.90:8080/target/target-script-min.js'></script>` was added, suggesting development/debugging tooling.
*   There were commented-out `shaka` player script imports (e.g., `shaka-4-7-1.js` and `vtt.js`) and a new import `<script type='text/javascript' src='/libs/player/shaka.4.13.8.js'></script>` was introduced, indicating an upgrade or specific version selection for the Shaka Player library.
*   An `ima3.js` script from `imasdk.googleapis.com` was added, likely for integrating Google Interactive Media Ads.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (20/2/2026, 12:16:57)

This log shows a single comprehensive change to the `App.jsx` file.
*   **Context Providers:** Added `DidomiProvider`, `ParentalControlProvider`, `SettingsContextProvider`, `TextsContextProvider`, and `HighlightProvider` to the application's context tree. This significantly expands the global state and functionality available to components.
*   **Route Structure:** Expanded the `Routes` definition, adding new `PublicRoute` and `PrivateRoute` wrappers, and including routes for `Collection`, `Directes`, `AllCatalog`, `AccessibleContent`, `LastDays`, `PlayerLoader`, `DetailPage`, `GridPage`, `SearchPage`, and `Configuration`. This indicates a major restructuring or expansion of the application's navigation and view components.
*   **Debug and Global Functions:** Introduced `InitDevConsole` for enhanced logging, and attached `openExitAppModal` and `openCloseSessionModal` to `window.AppGlobal.Actions`. Also added `BuildInfo`, `DebugConfigPane`, `DebugSessionSettingsPane`, and `DebugModalsLauncher` components, suggesting improved debugging capabilities and build information display.
*   **Platform Initialization:** The `Platform.initPlatform()` and `Platform.initKeyboard()` calls are now explicitly within an `InitApp` function triggered by a `useEffect` hook.
*   **Modal Management:** Introduced `exitModal` state and associated handlers (`openExitAppModal`, `closeExitAppModal`, `handleCancel`, `handleOk`) for managing different types of exit/logout modals.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (20/2/2026, 13:13:26)

This log reflects a single large update to Tizen-specific platform logic.
*   **Visibility Change Handling:** Enhanced the `visibilitychange` event listener to pause/stop `window.AppGlobal.Player` when the app is hidden and play when resumed, along with a `history.go(-1)` on hide.
*   **Exit Application:** Added a new `evExitApplication` event listener that calls `tizen.application.getCurrentApplication().exit()` to properly exit the Tizen application.
*   **Network State Listener:** Implemented `initNetworkStateListener` using `webapis.network.addNetworkStateChangeListener` to dispatch `evNetworkDisconnected` and `evNetworkConnected` events based on network state changes.
*   **Screen Saver Management:** Introduced `initScreenSaverHelpers` to control the Tizen screen saver (enable/disable) and update `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.status`.
*   **Keyboard Key Registration:** `initExtraSamsungKeys` was added to register additional Samsung TV remote keys like media control keys (Play, Pause, Stop, Rewind, FastForward) and color buttons.
*   **App Launch and Store Integration:** New functions `launchAppTizen` and `openSamsungStore` were added to handle launching other Tizen applications or opening the Samsung TV app store.
*   **Debugging Enhancements:** Several `ajsrConsole.log` calls were added throughout the file, along with `debugTizenAppCommon` function, indicating an increase in logging for Tizen-specific debugging.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerLoader.jsx` (20/2/2026, 18:52:39)

This file saw a single change, primarily focused on player advertisement logic and subtitle styling.
*   **Ad Tag URL Handling:** The logic for `_currentVODAdTagUrl` was significantly updated. The previous version used `stripQuery` to remove query parameters. The new version introduces `build3catVmapUrl` (and `getVmapParamsPlatform`) to dynamically build the VMAP URL by replacing macros (`__platform__`, `__gdpr__`, etc.) with real values, ensuring proper ad targeting. This is conditional on `window.config.ads.enabled`.
*   **Subtitle Styling:** Functions `setSubtitlesStyles` and `removeSubtitlesStyles` were added to dynamically apply CSS classes to the `cueContainer` based on user `optionsProvider` settings for font size, background color, and position. `setSubtitlesStyles()` is called directly, indicating an immediate application of styles.
*   **Screen Saver Interaction:** Added calls to `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.disable()` on component mount and `window.AppGlobal.ScreenSaver.enable()` on cleanup, indicating screen saver management during player activity.
*   **Buffering Indicator:** `window.BufferingIndicator.show()` and `window.BufferingIndicator.hide()` calls were added to manage a buffering indicator.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (20/2/2026, 18:58:23 - 20/2/2026, 19:25:16)

This file handles generic Smart TV keyboard navigation. The changes primarily involved refining event handling for `keydown`.
*   **Event Propagation Control:** The lines `e.preventDefault();` and `e.stopPropagation();` were initially commented out (20/2/2026, 18:58:23), then uncommented together (20/2/2026, 19:05:58). In a subsequent commit (20/2/2026, 19:15:17), `e.stopPropagation()` was commented out while `e.preventDefault()` remained active. Finally, `e.stopPropagation()` was moved to the end of the `onKeyDownHandler` function (20/2/2026, 19:21:43) and then removed entirely (20/2/2026, 19:25:16). This iterative change demonstrates a careful adjustment of event handling, likely to balance preventing default browser actions with allowing event propagation when desired for certain platform-specific or application-level listeners.
*   **Player Key Handling:** Added a conditional check `if (PLAYER_KEYS.has(keyCode) && (!window.AppGlobal.Player || !window.AppGlobal.Player.isReady))` to ignore player-related key presses if the player is not ready, preventing unintended actions.
*   **Debug Key '3':** The handling for key code `51` (number '3') was added to update an element with `id='buildNumber'` to display the build number.
*   **Consolidation of Key Handling:** Player-related key presses (Play, Pause, Stop, Rewind, Fast Forward) were added to the `PLAYER_KEYS` set and also explicitly handled within the generic `switch (keyCode)` block, in addition to platform-specific blocks (WebOS, Tizen).

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss` (23/2/2026, 12:40:42)

This commit introduced a new font-face definition.
*   **New Font Format:** Added WOFF format font files for "Bw 3Cat" to complement the existing TTF files, improving cross-browser and cross-platform compatibility and potentially load times. This includes `bw3cat-black.woff`, `bw3cat-bold.woff`, `bw3cat-medium.woff`, `bw3cat-regular.woff`, and `bw3cat-thin.woff`.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 17:26:19 - 23/2/2026, 17:27:28)

Minor changes related to favorite status.
*   **Interval Removal:** An `setInterval` that called `refresh_LOCAL_FavoritesList` every 3 seconds was removed from the initial `useEffect` hook. The `refresh_LOCAL_FavoritesList` is now called only once on mount. This likely optimizes performance by reducing unnecessary frequent checks for favorite status.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 19:07:16)

This change added new attributes and improved image handling.
*   **`navFixedFocusShape`:** Introduced a dynamic `navFixedFocusShape` attribute for focus management, which adapts based on whether the content is external.
*   **`generateImageDataFromLiveChannelInHome_v2`:** Changed the image data generation function to `generateImageDataFromLiveChannelInHome_v2`, indicating an update to how live channel images are processed.
*   **External Content Display:** Added new UI elements (`platform-footer`, `platform-logo`, `platform-icon`, `tag live`, `tag upcoming`) to better display external live content, including platform logos and status tags (EN DIRECTE / UPCOMING).
*   **Audio Icon:** Included an `AudioIcon` component to indicate audio-only media types.
*   **Title Filtering:** The `title` display logic was updated to filter out `null` values more robustly when joining parts of the title.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx` (24/2/2026, 10:52:48 - 24/2/2026, 14:18:59)

This hook saw significant refactoring for row virtualization.
*   **State Initialization from Saved State:** The hook now initializes `visibleRows`, `accumulatedTranslate`, `accumulatedTop`, `currentRow`, `idToFocus`, and `rowXTranslatePos` from `savedState` fetched from `useVirtualizationContext`. This ensures that the scroll position and visible rows are preserved across navigations if saved.
*   **Improved Row Navigation Logic:** The `handleRowNavigation` callback was extensively refined.
    *   Previously, the logic for calculating `newVisibleRows` and `accumulatedTop` was less explicit about window adjustment.
    *   Changes (24/2/2026, 10:56:20) introduced explicit logic for adjusting `accumulatedTop` only when the `start` index of the visible window changes, and a more robust wrap-around logic (`newCurrentRow = 0; setAccumulatedTranslate(0); setAccumulatedTop(0); setVisibleRows([...Array(windowSize).keys()]); setCurrentRow(0); return;`) when navigating down from the last row.
*   **Virtualization State Management:**
    *   The `resetVirtualization` function was updated to save the initial state to the `virtualizationContext` using `setPageState`.
    *   The `saveVirtualization` function now explicitly saves `idToFocus` and `rowXTranslatePos`.
    *   A `removeVirtualizationState` function was added and is called when the `pageId` changes, ensuring that old page states are cleaned up.
*   **`syncVirtualizationWithData`:** A new function `syncVirtualizationWithData` was added to the return object (24/2/2026, 14:18:41) but was then removed (24/2/2026, 14:18:59). This suggests an abandoned attempt to introduce a more granular synchronization method for virtualization states when underlying data changes.

`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (24/2/2026, 20:47:55)

This component, responsible for rendering generic rows, received updates for new item types and focus management.
*   **New Row Element Mappings:** Updated the `getRowElement` and `getShowAllElementsFocusShape` functions to include new row types: `SQUARE_MINI`, `INLINE`, `FEATURED`, `HERO`, `LIVE_TV`, and `LAST_DAYS`. This suggests the introduction of new visual styles and content arrangements.
*   **Dynamic `showAll` Button:** The `generateShowAllElements` function was refactored to dynamically create a "Show All" button, incorporating `useEffect` for focus registration/unregistration.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Added logic for `FEATURED` and `HERO` row types to potentially slice `rowItems` or push `rowData` as the sole item, indicating specialized rendering for these prominent row types.
*   **External Row Styling:** Introduced `isExternalRow` detection and a corresponding CSS class, suggesting visual differentiation for external content rows.
*   **Accessibility and Focus Attributes:** Added numerous `data-` attributes for enhanced focus management and navigation, including `data-nav-strategy`, `data-nav-fixed-focus-shape`, `data-block-focus-right`, `data-group-restore-last-focused`, `data-on-lost-left-action`, and `data-on-receive-focus-action`.
*   **Audio Icon Support:** Added `showAudioIcon={item.media_type === 'audio'}` prop to `RowElement` to conditionally display an audio icon.

**Overall Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focus Management:** A strong recurring theme is the meticulous management of focus (`nav.fixedFocus.isNavigating`, `nav.move.up/down/left/right`, `nav.action()`, `registerFocusAction`, `unregisterFocusAction`, `window.nav.focusById`). This indicates a focus-driven UI, common in Smart TV applications where remote control navigation is primary.
*   **Virtualization:** The `useVirtualizedRows` hook and its integration in `index.jsx` show a commitment to optimizing rendering performance by virtualizing rows, especially crucial for content-heavy pages. The changes also show a progression in refining how virtualization state is saved, restored, and reset in response to data changes.
*   **Live Data Refresh:** The logic for `refreshLives` and `checkTimeFrame` in `index.jsx` is central, continuously updating live content based on API calls and applying time-based filtering. The frequent adjustments to `live_refresh_interval` and `setPageData` calls highlight ongoing fine-tuning of this real-time update mechanism.
*   **Platform-Specific Adaptations:** The `generic.js` and `tizen.js` files demonstrate the need for platform-specific keyboard handling, screen saver controls, and application lifecycle management, characteristic of developing for diverse Smart TV operating systems.
*   **Debugging and Logging:** Frequent additions and removals of `console.log` statements and the use of `ajsrConsole` indicate an active development and debugging environment, with a strong emphasis on understanding application behavior across different components and platforms.
*   **Context API Usage:** The `App.jsx` file heavily uses React's Context API (e.g., `AuthContext`, `OptionsContext`, `SettingsContext`, `SitecatalystContext`, `CapabilitiesContext`, `VirtualizationContext`, `HighlightContext`), centralizing state management and making various application-wide configurations and data accessible to components.
*   **Dynamic UI Elements:** The ability to dynamically add new row types and modify their display (e.g., external content indicators, audio icons, "Show All" buttons) suggests a flexible and extensible UI architecture.

## 3:38:59
The provided log details changes across several JavaScript (JSX) and SCSS files within the `3cat_smarttv` project, focusing primarily on component logic, state management, and platform-specific behaviors.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (20/2/2026, 12:11:57 - 24/2/2026, 14:44:26):**
    *   This file, representing a `Page` component, saw a large number of iterative changes, primarily in its `checkTimeFrame` and `getHomeData` functions, and related `useEffect` hooks.
    *   **Live Refresh Interval:** Initially, `live_refresh_interval` was hardcoded to `3000`, then `10000`, and later changed to dynamically use `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`. There was a brief period where it was set to `2000` and `1000`, and even a very large `6000000` (likely for testing a static state or debugging), before reverting to `settingsData?.live_refresh_interval || 10000`.
    *   **`checkTimeFrame` Logic:** Significant refactoring occurred in `checkTimeFrame` to manage the `pageData` state more efficiently.
        *   Initial versions directly set `pageData` after filtering children and merging live data.
        *   Later changes introduced a `hasRefreshed` ref and conditional logic to prevent unnecessary re-renders on subsequent live data refreshes. It attempted to update `pageData` only if `hasRefreshed.current` was false (for the initial load), otherwise, it would directly update `homeDataRef.current`.
        *   Further modifications (23/2/2026, 19:09:03) introduced a `livePositionsToUpdate` Set and more granular state updates, attempting to only update specific "live rows" within the `pageData` to optimize rendering.
        *   Subsequent reverts (23/2/2026, 23:31:18 onwards) simplified this back to directly setting `pageData` with the full filtered data, and then introduced `setTimeout` blocks (e.g., 24/2/2026, 13:07:23) to perform actions like removing an item at index 3 after a delay (e.g., 10000ms, then 20000ms), which seems to be a debugging or testing mechanism for dynamic content changes.
        *   The `checkTimeFrame` function also saw changes to how `newChildren` were derived and how `setPageData` was called, often incorporating logic to prevent re-renders if the data hadn't truly changed, and handling `rowsChanged` scenarios by calling `resetVirtualization` and `navigate(location.pathname, { replace: true })` (e.g., 24/2/2026, 14:24:54).
    *   **`useEffect` for Mock Data (24/2/2026, 13:40:08):** A temporary `useEffect` was added to `index.jsx` that introduced a `setInterval` to periodically create `fakeEntries` and manually `splice` an item at index 3 from `homeDataRef.current.children`, then call `checkTimeFrame`. This was likely a testing mechanism for row removal and live data updates, and it was removed in subsequent commits (24/2/2026, 13:41:46).
    *   **Import Optimization:** Standardized imports from separate `import` statements to a single, grouped `import { ... } from 'react'` statement.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\index.html` (20/2/2026, 12:16:22):**
    *   Updated Shaka Player library from `shaka-4-7-1.js` (commented out) to `shaka.4.13.8.js`.
    *   Added `ima3.js` for Google Interactive Media Ads SDK.
    *   Included a `purple-console.min.js` and `easy.qrcode.min.js` script.
    *   Added a `<div id="cueContainer"></div>` within the player setup.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (20/2/2026, 12:16:57):**
    *   Added `VideoSpinner` component.
    *   Included `App.kids.scss` stylesheet.
    *   Modified the `InitDevConsole` function to configure `ajsrConsole` with specific colors, font size, and print strategy.
    *   Added new debug info for `Player`, `Media type`, and `Ads` to the `BuildInfo` component.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (20/2/2026, 13:13:26):**
    *   Added `ajsrConsole.log` calls for Tizen-specific debugging information.
    *   Enhanced `initAppTizen` to specifically log device model and manufacturer using `tizen.systeminfo.getPropertyValue('BUILD')`.
    *   Updated the `visibilitychange` event listener to include `webapis.avplay.stop()` when the app is hidden on Tizen.
    *   Modified `initScreenSaverHelpers` to use `ajsrConsole.log` for status updates and update a debug element (`debug-info-screensaver`).
    *   Extended `initExtraSamsungKeys` to register more keys like `ColorF0Red`, `ColorF1Green`, `ColorF2Yellow`, `ColorF3Blue`, numeric keys ('0'-'9'), and `ChannelDown`/`ChannelUp`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\player\playerLoader.jsx` (20/2/2026, 18:52:39):**
    *   Added `removeSubtitlesStyles` and `setSubtitlesStyles` functions to manage CSS classes on `cueContainer` based on `optionsProvider` for subtitle styling (font size, background color, position).
    *   Updated ad VMAP URL handling logic: changed from `stripQuery` to `build3catVmapUrl` and `getVmapParamsPlatform` to replace macros with real values for dynamic ad tag generation.
    *   Included logic to `show()` and `hide()` a global `window.BufferingIndicator`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (20/2/2026, 18:58:23 - 20/2/2026, 19:25:16):**
    *   Focused on `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartTV` function.
    *   Initially, `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` were commented out in the `onKeyDownHandler` (18:58:23).
    *   These were explicitly added back in subsequent commits (19:05:58), then `e.stopPropagation()` was commented out again (19:15:17), and finally re-added (19:21:43), before being removed completely from the `onKeyDownHandler` in the last log entries for this file (19:25:16). This indicates experimentation with event handling behavior for key presses across different Smart TV platforms.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\fonts.scss` (23/2/2026, 12:40:42):**
    *   Added new `@font-face` rules for "Bw 3Cat" and "Roboto" fonts, including different weights and styles, using both `.ttf` and `.woff` formats.
    *   Set the default `body` font-family to "Bw 3Cat".

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\buttons\btnFavoriteMemory\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 17:26:19 - 23/2/2026, 17:27:28):**
    *   Removed a `setInterval` that was refreshing local favorites every 3 seconds from the `useEffect` hook, streamlining favorite status updates to rely on direct actions or item changes.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\liveItemHome\index.jsx` (23/2/2026, 19:07:16):**
    *   Improved image data generation by using `generateImageDataFromLiveChannelInHome_v2` for better handling of live channel images.
    *   Enhanced display of external content with platform logos and an external link icon.
    *   Added logic to display "EN DIRECTE" or "UPCOMING" tags based on `isLiveExternal` and `whiteTagText` from a `useExternalEmission` hook.
    *   Adjusted title rendering for `audio` media types to include a "with presenter" text.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\hooks\useVirtualizedRows.jsx` (24/2/2026, 10:52:48 - 24/2/2026, 14:18:59):**
    *   Multiple iterations refined the virtualization logic.
    *   Initially, `handleRowNavigation` updated `currentRow` and `visibleRows`, recalculating the window based on `currentRow`.
    *   Later versions (24/2/2026, 10:56:20) added explicit logic to handle "wrap-around" navigation (moving from last row to first, or vice-versa) and to adjust `accumulatedTop` only when the visible window's start index changes, aiming for smoother scrolling.
    *   A `syncVirtualizationWithData` function was intended to be passed to `Page` (24/2/2026, 14:18:41) but was then removed, indicating a change in approach or a feature that was not fully implemented or was later considered unnecessary in `useVirtualizedRows`. The parent component `index.jsx` instead directly calls `resetVirtualization()` and `removeVirtualizationState()` on row count changes.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (24/2/2026, 20:47:55):**
    *   The `getRowElement` function was updated to use a more precise `rowType` argument and removed `rowItems.length` from its parameters.
    *   Added a `LastDayItem` case to `getRowElement` for `LAST_DAYS` row type.
    *   Refined the `onFocusAction` logic for `FEATURED` and `INLINE` row types to pass `item` or `null` based on type.
    *   Improved the `ShowAllElements` component logic and `data-nav-fixed-focus-shape` attribute generation.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **React State Management:** Heavy reliance on `useState`, `useRef`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` hooks across `Page`, `PlayerLoader`, and `useVirtualizedRows` components to manage component state, side effects, and performance optimizations.
*   **Platform-Specific Logic:** Frequent checks for `window.AppGlobal.platform` (e.g., `hbbtv`, `webos`, `tizen`) to apply platform-specific behaviors, such as filtering content, handling key events, or interacting with native APIs (e.g., `tizen.systeminfo`, `webapis.network`). This is a strong recurring pattern demonstrating a cross-platform application.
*   **Live Content Refresh:** A core recurring theme is the implementation and refinement of live content refreshing. This involves:
    *   Fetching "Now Playing" data (`ApiGetNowPlaying`, `ApiGetNowPlayingSelector`).
    *   Merging live data into existing `pageData` (e.g., `mergeData`, `replaceItemInDirectesChildren`).
    *   Filtering out unsupported live content based on capabilities (`isLiveSupportedRef`).
    *   Using `setInterval` for periodic refreshes with a configurable `live_refresh_interval`.
    *   Optimizing re-renders by detecting data changes in arrays or using refs to store data, attempting to prevent full state updates when only parts of the data change.
*   **Virtualization and Navigation:** The `useVirtualizedRows` hook, used by `Page`, is central to handling efficient rendering and navigation across large lists of rows. Changes here consistently involve managing `visibleRows`, `accumulatedTranslate`, `accumulatedTop`, `currentRow`, and saving/restoring this state. Navigation events (`customNavigation`) trigger updates to these virtualization states.
*   **Error Handling and Authentication:** API calls (`ApiHome`, `ApiContent_NO_PROMISE`) consistently include error handling that checks for "Unauthorized" or "Token expired" messages, leading to logout and redirection to authentication screens.
*   **Styling:** SCSS files (`styles.scss`, `styles.kids.scss`) are consistently used for component-specific styling, indicating a component-based styling approach with considerations for child-specific themes.
*   **Debugging and Testing Mechanisms:** Several temporary additions, like hardcoded `live_refresh_interval` values, `console.log` statements with `ajsrConsole`, and a `useEffect` with a `setInterval` to mock row removal, indicate active debugging and testing during this period. These were often reverted or refined shortly after their introduction.
