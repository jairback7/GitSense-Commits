# Activity Summary for 6/2/2026

## 0:05:10
The provided log details code changes across various JavaScript and SCSS files, primarily within a Smart TV application project, with a strong focus on UI/UX, navigation, and platform-specific adaptations.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\3cat_pro\gateway\js\app.js` (2/2/2026, 14:16:27)**
    *   This file handles the initial application startup, determining the WebOS SDK version to configure the correct connection manager (`WEBOS_MANAGER` or `PALM_MANAGER`) and a remote URL (`REMOTE`).
    *   It checks for internet connectivity. If available, it redirects the user; otherwise, it displays an alert and sets up a `keydown` listener for the back button to exit the platform.
    *   A subscription to the connection manager's status is established to react to changes in internet availability, automatically redirecting to the `REMOTE` URL if connectivity is restored.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx` (2/2/2026, 16:31:34)**
    *   This component is responsible for rendering detailed media information (title, description, duration, age rating, tags, etc.).
    *   It includes logic for displaying episode and season counts, with a comment mentioning `CCMA-1685`.
    *   A significant commented-out section (`JIRA CCMA-2104`) indicates the removal of "A partir del" (available from) publication functionality.
    *   It differentiates rendering based on item properties like `is_episode`, `isLive`, `isUpcomingEvent`, `tag_format`, and `collection`.
    *   New `is_external` and `external_content_data` properties are introduced to display external platform logos and tags.
    *   Calculations are performed to determine whether to show separator dots between various media info elements.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\mediaTitle\styles.scss` (2/2/2026, 16:33:36)**
    *   This SCSS file defines styles for media titles.
    *   It introduces specific styling for different title types like `.title_program`, `.live`, `.isLive_or_upcoming_event`, `.stream`, and `.menu_detail`, primarily adjusting font-weight and font-size. An `.external` class also modifies font-size.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\portraitItem\styles.scss` (2/2/2026, 16:39:57)**
    *   Styles for portrait-oriented items in rows.
    *   Focus states (`.focused`, `:hover`) are defined with a red box-shadow and outline.
    *   Includes styles for a tag (white background, black text, rounded corners) and a `platform-logo` for external content, positioned at the bottom-left of the item.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\keyboard\styles.scss` (Multiple timestamps: 2/2/2026, 16:56:08 & 2/2/2026, 17:09:25)**
    *   This file defines the styling for an on-screen keyboard.
    *   Key elements (`.keyboard-key`) have dark backgrounds, white text, and rounded corners.
    *   It defines different sizes for keys (`.SMALL`, `.MEDIUM`, `.LARGE`) and uses background images for special keys like backspace, spacebar, and return.
    *   The `:hover` state for keyboard keys was added at 17:09:25, providing visual feedback with a red box-shadow and border, matching the `.focused` state.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (Multiple timestamps: 2/2/2026, 17:08:44 & 5/2/2026, 13:32:40)**
    *   This file handles generic keyboard navigation and player control for Smart TVs.
    *   It initializes `window.AppGlobal.KeyMemory` to track key combinations, which can trigger specific actions (e.g., enabling/disabling ads with "123" or "321").
    *   The `onKeyDownHandler` processes various key codes (arrows, enter, back, player controls) and dispatches navigation or player actions.
    *   Platform-specific key codes are handled for WebOS and Tizen.
    *   A significant change at 5/2/2026, 13:32:40 involved commenting out the `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` from `onKeyDownHandler` and commenting out the `dispatchRewindEvent()` and `dispatchFastForwardEvent()` calls within the platform-specific `switch` statements, indicating a potential change in event handling or player control logic.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps: 2/2/2026, 17:36:09 & 2/2/2026, 17:36:22)**
    *   This component manages the application's side menu, including navigation logic and user-specific menu options (e.g., for kids' profiles).
    *   It uses React hooks for state management and effects, reacting to location changes and user authentication status.
    *   The `AppMenuCreate` function initializes global `window.AppMenu.vars` for menu state.
    *   It dynamically generates L1 and L2 menu data based on user type and settings.
    *   Includes logic to attach a "Search" option at the beginning of the menu data.
    *   The two timestamps show almost identical code, with a minor addition in the `useEffect` hook at `17:36:22` to set `window.__isEntry = isMenuVisible;`, which was commented out in the prior version.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\onboarding\usersScreen\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps between 2/2/2026, 17:45:11 and 2/2/2026, 18:14:59)**
    *   This screen displays a list of users, including "Super3" (kids' profile) and an option to add a new user.
    *   It manages user selection, redirection, and authentication context.
    *   Multiple small changes across several timestamps primarily involve commenting/uncommenting the `window.__isEntry` assignment and introducing a `window.__foceEntry` variable with a `useEffect` hook to set and reset it, suggesting debugging or temporary changes related to entry point handling. The core functionality remains consistent: displaying user bubbles and handling user/kid/guest selection and navigation.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\utils\goBackHistory.js` (2/2/2026, 18:15:16)**
    *   The `goBackHistory` function now checks for `window.__isEntry` or `window.__foceEntry` variables in addition to specific paths (`/welcomeScreen`, `/home`, `/`) to trigger a callback function for exiting the app.
    *   It also adds specific handling for the media player (to hide audio/subs menu) before performing a standard `history.go(-1)`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (Multiple timestamps between 2/2/2026, 18:50:50 and 2/2/2026, 19:14:36)**
    *   This is the main application component, setting up routing, context providers, and global actions.
    *   It defines `InitDevConsole` for a custom debug console and `InitApp` for platform initialization.
    *   The `BuildInfo` component displays various environment and build details based on `window.appConfig.test_app` flags.
    *   The `AppInner` component handles modals (exit, logout), user authentication redirects, and defines routes for various views.
    *   Multiple minor changes across these timestamps relate to the `openExitAppModal` function. Initially, it sets `window.isUserModalVisible = true` and `nav.storedFocus`, then comments these out temporarily (e.g., 18:51:35), then reintroduces them (e.g., 18:54:07). At 18:52:39, `window.AppMenu.manageFocused?.()` was briefly added to `openExitAppModal`. These changes suggest an iterative process of refining modal visibility and focus management.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\tizen\3cat_pro\config.xml` (Multiple timestamps: 3/2/2026, 13:24:24, 5/2/2026, 10:47:12 & 5/2/2026, 11:41:17)**
    *   This XML file configures the Tizen application.
    *   At `5/2/2026, 10:47:12`, the `id` attribute of the `<widget>` element was changed from `"http://tizen.tv3.ccma.cat.qa"` to `"http://tizen.qa.ccma.cat"`, and the `id` and `package` attributes of the `<tizen:application>` element were updated (e.g., `PzkKxRdFT6.TV3.qa` to `PzkKxRdFT6qa.TV3`). These changes likely reflect a shift in application identifier or environment (e.g., from a general QA to a more specific QA identifier). The subsequent change at `5/2/2026, 11:41:17` shows no functional changes from the previous one.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 11:36:24 and 4/2/2026, 14:01:29)**
    *   This component renders round-shaped items in rows, often used for categories or profiles.
    *   Initial changes involve uncommenting logic to handle `isKidsProfile` and find "round" images.
    *   Later changes at `4/2/2026, 12:08:06` modify the `image_format` search for `isKidsProfile` from `'round'` to `'big-round'`.
    *   Subsequent changes (e.g., `12:21:39`) simplify image type checks, removing `isKidsProfile` from the `useMemo` dependency and the class assignment. This logic is then reintroduced with `isBigRound` property and explicit `big-round` image format search for kids mode, as well as the addition of `data-nav-fixed-focus-shape` set to `bigRound` or `round`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.kids.scss` (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:22:36 and 4/2/2026, 14:12:14)**
    *   This file provides kid-mode specific styling for `roundElement`.
    *   Initially set `background-color` and `border` to `$base-color-3cat-kid-bright-purple` when focused (`12:23:43`), but later reverted the border (`12:25:30`) and eventually simplified to just setting the background color.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.kids.scss` (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:26:49 and 4/2/2026, 14:14:40)**
    *   This file defines kid-mode styles for the fixed focus indicator.
    *   Changes iterate on the `box-shadow` and `border-color` for the `.inner` element, consistently using `$base-color-3cat-kid-light-purple`.
    *   There were several attempts to define specific styles for `.round` focus shape (e.g., setting `width`, `height`, `box-shadow`, `border`) and then commenting/removing them (e.g., `12:30:18` to `12:35:49`), before reintroducing and refining them. The final change at `14:14:40` removes `outline: 0px;` for `.round` and `.bigRound` focus shapes.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\rowUtils.js` (Multiple timestamps: 4/2/2026, 12:01:27 & 4/2/2026, 12:01:36)**
    *   The `getRowkind` function, which determines the type of row based on `rowData` properties, was updated to correctly identify `ROUND` rows.
    *   Specifically, `rowData.format === 'square-mini'` was changed to `rowData.format === 'square_mini'`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:02:26 and 4/2/2026, 12:54:35)**
    *   This component renders various types of content rows.
    *   Updated `getRowElement` to include `SQUARE_MINI` (mapping to `SquareItem`).
    *   Updated `getShowAllElementsFocusShape` to include `SQUARE_MINI` (mapping to `'square'`).
    *   At `4/2/2026, 12:49:54`, the `isKidsProfile && <div className="roundItemTitle">{item.title}</div>` was added at the end of the component's return, but then removed at `12:54:35`, suggesting temporary or experimental UI elements.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\styles.scss` (4/2/2026, 12:48:42)**
    *   Styles for generic rows, including various row types like `HERO`, `LANDSCAPE`, `USER_ROW`, `SQUARE`, `LIVE_TV`, `PORTRAIT`, `LANDSCAPE_MINI`, `INLINE`, `FEATURED`, `LAST_DAYS`.
    *   Defines specific widths, heights, and padding for different row types.
    *   Styles for the `item-show-all` element are also defined, including its icon and hover/focus states.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 12:27:53 and 4/2/2026, 13:42:39)**
    *   This component renders rows specifically for round items.
    *   It initially included `styles.kids.scss` which was then removed (`12:30:58`).
    *   The `isKidsProfile` prop was removed from the `RoundItem` and `textAlign` style was changed to always `left` at `12:56:05`.
    *   Later, `isBigRound` prop was introduced, influencing both `textAlign` and the root div's class name (`biground_row` or `round_row`). It also adds a `roundItemTitle` for `isBigRound` items. This suggests a new design for displaying larger round items, possibly for kids' profiles, but handled with a more generic `isBigRound` prop.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\styles.scss` (Multiple timestamps: 4/2/2026, 12:28:04 & 4/2/2026, 13:40:37)**
    *   Styles for `round_row`.
    *   At `13:40:37`, a new `.biground_row` class was introduced with a larger height, and common styles were grouped for both `round_row` and `biground_row`. Also introduced `roundItemTitle` styles.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\styles.kids.scss` (Multiple timestamps: 4/2/2026, 12:30:18)**
    *   Contains a commented-out style for `round_row` height in kid mode, indicating a possible future or discarded styling.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 13:25:55 and 4/2/2026, 13:34:44)**
    *   This component fetches and renders page data, including rows of content.
    *   It has logic for refreshing live content and filtering children based on `isLiveSupported` and `isShakaPlayerSupported`.
    *   A filter was added to remove `user_row` if the `activeUser` is of type `KID`.
    *   The two timestamps show no functional difference in the provided code snippets.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.scss` (Multiple timestamps between 4/2/2026, 14:02:04 and 4/2/2026, 14:26:32)**
    *   Defines styles for fixed focus elements across different shapes (`keyframe`, `round`, `bigRound`, `poster`, `square`, `landscape-mini`).
    *   A new `.bigRound` focus shape was introduced at `14:02:35` with larger dimensions and specific box-shadow/border colors.
    *   At `14:09:26`, the `.page` context for focus was updated to apply to both `.round` and `.bigRound` shapes.
    *   The `box-shadow` and `border` for `.bigRound` were updated at `14:26:06` and `14:26:27` to use `$base-color-3cat-kid-white !important`, overriding previous values, suggesting a refinement for kid-mode focus styling.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.kids.scss` (4/2/2026, 14:18:09)**
    *   Adds general kid-mode styling for focused elements within scrollable containers, applying a light purple box-shadow, border-color, and outline.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\index.jsx` (Multiple timestamps: 4/2/2026, 15:12:08 & 4/2/2026, 15:15:17 & 4/2/2026, 15:17:01)**
    *   This modal displays information for external content.
    *   At `15:15:17`, a `partner` class was dynamically added to `popupLeft` based on `isPartner`.
    *   At `15:17:01`, the `generateImageData` function call was updated to adjust the image height based on `isPartner` (428px for partners, 544px otherwise), and `isPartner` was added to its `useMemo` dependency.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss` (4/2/2026, 15:15:02)**
    *   Styles for the external content modal.
    *   A `.partner` class was added within `popupLeft` to reduce its height to `428px`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\libs\img.js` (Multiple timestamps between 5/2/2026, 9:38:25 and 5/2/2026, 9:46:57)**
    *   This utility file provides functions for image handling, including `getImgProxyUrl`, `removeItemsFromArray`, `getBestImage`, `getBestImageV2`, `getLogoImage`, `getImageByFormat`, `generateImageData`, and `generateImageDataFromLiveChannelInHome_v2`.
    *   The `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` array was modified at `9:38:51` to include `"square-round"` in `getBestImageV2` function's `notAllowedFomats` list, specifically when `desiredAspect` is `LANDSCAPE`.
    *   At `9:40:33`, `square-round` was added to `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` constant and then again at `9:44:04`, `big-round` was added to `notAllowedFomats` in `getBestImageV2` for landscape aspect. These changes indicate a refinement in how images with specific formats are filtered or prioritized. The `9:46:50` and `9:46:57` changes also involve minor refactoring in `getImgProxyUrl` and `removeItemsFromArray` for conciseness.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Date & Time Consistency:** All entries are from `2/2/2026` for most code files and `3/2/2026` or `5/2/2026` for `config.xml` and `img.js` files, indicating concentrated development efforts over a few days. The second day, `4/2/2026`, shows extensive modifications related to UI components and focus management.
*   **Focus Management:** A significant recurring theme is the meticulous handling of focus within the Smart TV application. Many components (`RoundItem`, `GenericRow`, `SideMenu`, `UsersScreen`, `ExternalContentModal`) use `nav.focusById()` and `registerFocusAction`/`unregisterFocusAction` (from `focusActionRegistry.js`). This highlights a strong emphasis on keyboard/remote navigation, which is critical for TV applications.
*   **Kid Mode / User Profiles:** Several files (`mediaInfo`, `sideMenu`, `usersScreen`, `roundItem`, `fixedFocus`, `App.jsx`, `App.kids.scss`, `page.jsx`) contain logic and styling specifically for a "kid-mode" or "Super3" user profile. This suggests a dedicated effort to create a distinct and safe experience for younger users, often involving different menu options, content filtering, and visual themes.
*   **Platform Specificity:** The `platform/generic.js` and `gateway/js/app.js` files, along with the Tizen `config.xml`, demonstrate the need for platform-specific adaptations for different Smart TV operating systems (WebOS, Tizen, HbbTV) for features like connection management, keyboard input, and application identifiers.
*   **Modular Component Development:** The project structure heavily relies on React components (`components/`, `views/`) and utility functions (`utils/`, `libs/`), promoting reusability and maintainability.
*   **UI/UX Refinements:** Numerous SCSS changes across `mediaTitle`, `portraitItem`, `keyboard`, `fixedFocus`, `genericRow`, `roundRow`, and `externalContentModal` styles point to continuous refinement of the application's visual appearance and user experience, especially around focus states and various content display formats.
*   **Global `window.AppGlobal` Usage:** The `window.AppGlobal` object is extensively used across several files (`generic.js`, `sideMenu`, `App.jsx`, `usersScreen`, `goBackHistory.js`, `page.jsx`) to store and access global application state, actions, and utilities.
*   **Image Handling:** The `libs/img.js` file shows detailed logic for selecting and processing images based on size, aspect ratio, format (e.g., `round`, `big-round`, `logo`), and external status, using an `IMGPROXY_URL` for optimization.
*   **Modal Interactions:** The `App.jsx` and `externalContentModal` components illustrate a pattern of using modals for critical user interactions (exit app, logout, external content warnings), often involving `nav.storedFocus` to return focus to the correct element after the modal closes.
*   **Feature Flags/Debug Information:** The `App.jsx` `BuildInfo` component and `InitDevConsole` function, along with scattered `console.log` statements, indicate the presence of debug features and configuration flags for testing and monitoring the application.

## 9:34:13
The changes log details a series of updates to a Smart TV application, primarily focusing on user interface, navigation, platform compatibility, and content display.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\3cat_pro\gateway\js\app.js` (2/2/2026, 14:16:27):** This file initializes a WebOS gateway application. It dynamically selects connection management services and a remote website URL based on the device's SDK version (e.g., SDK versions below 3.5.0 direct to `smartv-pro.3cat.website`). It checks for internet connectivity, either redirecting if available or displaying an alert and repeatedly checking the connection if offline. A `VK_BACK` key listener is implemented for platform-specific back actions.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx` (2/2/2026, 16:31:34):** A major update to the media information display component. It now includes enhanced logic for displaying episode/season counts, calculates and shows content expiration warnings, and handles different media types (live, upcoming events, external content) and user contexts. Complex logic determines the appropriate title and description, and rating tags are filtered for valid labels. A previously considered "Publication" feature was explicitly removed (referencing JIRA CCMA-2104).
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\mediaTitle\styles.scss` (2/2/2026, 16:33:36):** Introduced granular styling for media titles, applying different font sizes and weights based on the title's context, such as program titles, live streams, menu details, and external content, to improve visual distinction.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\portraitItem\styles.scss` (2/2/2026, 16:39:57):** Styles were added for `portraitItem` components, defining their default appearance, `focused` and `hover` states (using a red highlight), and specific styling for tags and logos from external platforms.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\keyboard\styles.scss` (2/2/2026, 16:56:08 & 17:09:25):** This stylesheet for the virtual keyboard received styling updates for key elements and introduced an active `&:hover` state to provide visual feedback upon mouseover, enhancing interactivity.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (2/2/2026, 17:08:44 & 5/2/2026, 13:32:40):** This file, crucial for Smart TV keyboard navigation, was initially set up to handle key combinations (e.g., for player ads) and platform-specific media controls (play, pause, stop, rewind, fast-forward) for WebOS and Tizen, along with back key logic. A later, significant update **disabled event throttling** and **commented out the rewind and fast-forward dispatch functions**, effectively removing that media control functionality across all platforms.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\index.jsx` (2/2/2026, 17:36:09 & 17:36:22):** The side menu component was updated to manage multi-level navigation and dynamic menu data based on user authentication and "kid-mode" status. A minor change involved setting `window.__isEntry` based on menu visibility during component initialization.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\onboarding\usersScreen\index.jsx` (Multiple changes on 2/2/2026):** This component for user selection underwent several rapid revisions. The `window.__isEntry` global flag's management was highly volatile: initially derived from `location.state`, it was temporarily hardcoded to `true`, then reverted, and finally, a new global flag `window.__foceEntry` was introduced and managed by this component on mount/unmount. The `onBackClick` behavior for the `PageHead` component was modified to consistently trigger `openExitAppModal`. `exitKidMode()` was also added to be called on loading.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\utils\goBackHistory.js` (2/2/2026, 18:15:16):** The `goBackHistory` utility was modified to include the new `window.__foceEntry` flag. If this flag or `window.__isEntry` is active (or on specific root paths), a provided callback (likely to exit the app) is executed immediately, overriding standard browser history navigation.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx` (Multiple changes on 2/2/2026):** The main application entry point saw multiple modifications, especially concerning the `openExitAppModal` function. Its behavior fluctuated between directly handling modal visibility and focus management, delegating it, and then reinstating direct control, indicating refinement in the application's exit flow. Debugging utilities and various context providers are also part of this file.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\tizen\3cat_pro\config.xml` (3/2/2026, 13:24:24 & 5/2/2026, 10:47:12):** The Tizen application manifest was updated to reflect new application `id` and `package` names (e.g., changing from `tizen.tv3.ccma.cat.qa` to `tizen.qa.ccma.cat`), likely indicating a re-naming or re-targeting for QA builds.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx` (Multiple changes on 4/2/2026):** This component for displaying round content items underwent extensive and iterative development. It included complex logic for selecting images and applying styles based on an `isKidsProfile` or `isBigRound` prop. This prop dynamically controlled the image `type` (e.g., `big-round`), the CSS class (`round-image`), and the `data-nav-fixed-focus-shape` attribute, leading to a highly refined visual presentation and focus behavior for different sizes of round items.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.scss` (4/2/2026, 13:53:09):** New styling for `.roundElement` and a specific `.biground_row .roundElement` class was introduced, defining distinct sizes, margins, borders, and text styles to support the `isBigRound` functionality.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.kids.scss` (Multiple changes on 4/2/2026):** This file saw numerous stylistic tweaks for `roundElement` within `kid-mode`, primarily applying `bright-purple` backgrounds and borders. There were several cycles of adding and removing border properties.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\rowUtils.js` (4/2/2026, 12:01:27 & 12:01:36):** A minor but important correction was made in the `getRowkind` utility to correctly identify rows with format `'square_mini'` as `ROUND` type, fixing a typo.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx` (Multiple changes on 4/2/2026):** This flexible component for rendering various row types was updated to map `SQUARE_MINI` to `SquareItem` and assign it a `'square'` focus shape. It also temporarily featured, then removed, a conditional `roundItemTitle` for kid profiles.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\styles.scss` (4/2/2026, 12:48:42):** Received substantial styling updates to support numerous `rowType_*` classes (e.g., `HERO`, `LANDSCAPE`, `SQUARE`), defining their dimensions and layout. A new `.item-show-all` element was also introduced with its own visual and focus styles.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\index.jsx` (Multiple changes on 4/2/2026):** This component for rows of round items iteratively incorporated and refined an `isBigRound` prop (formerly `isKidsProfile`). This prop now dictates the row's class name (`biground_row` or `round_row`), item alignment, and whether a title is displayed below each item. The import of `styles.kids.scss` was also added and removed in cycles.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\styles.scss` (4/2/2026, 13:40:37):** Defined distinct `height` properties for `.round_row` and `.biground_row`, and introduced styling for the `.roundItemTitle` text component.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx` (Multiple changes on 4/2/2026):** This core content page component continued its role in fetching and rendering dynamic content rows, handling live stream updates, and filtering content based on platform capabilities (e.g., HbbTV, Live/Shaka Player support) and user type (e.g., filtering `user_row` for kids). The multiple log entries on this date primarily represent saved states without significant functional changes between them.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.scss` (Multiple changes on 4/2/2026):** This stylesheet for the fixed focus indicator saw extensive development. It defined various focus shapes (`keyframe`, `round`, `bigRound`, `poster`, `square`, `landscape-mini`), their dimensions, shadows, and borders. Notably, the `bigRound` shape received specific styling with a `base-color-3cat-kid-white` highlight and `!important` declarations, and `round`/`bigRound` shapes were assigned specific top/left positioning within page contexts.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.kids.scss` (Multiple changes on 4/2/2026):** Similar to kid-mode item styles, this file saw many iterations to apply a `base-color-3cat-kid-light-purple` for box-shadows and borders of fixed focus elements in kid mode, with frequent toggling and refinement of outline properties for different focus shapes.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.kids.scss` (4/2/2026, 14:18:09):** A new general styling rule was added to provide focused scrollable elements in kid mode with a light purple box-shadow, border-color, and outline.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\index.jsx` (Multiple changes on 4/2/2026):** This modal for external content was enhanced to conditionally apply a `partner` CSS class and dynamically adjust the displayed image's height based on whether the content is from a partner (resulting in a square image) or not (portrait).
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss` (4/2/2026, 15:15:02):** This stylesheet defined the visual design for the external content modal, including its layout, dark transparent overlay, and specific styling for various content blocks like promo text, platform information, and button arrangement, with partner-specific layout adjustments.
*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\libs\img.js` (Multiple changes on 5/2/2026):** This library for image utility functions underwent multiple refinements. Changes included cleaning up the `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` array (removing duplicates, adding/removing `square-round`), and dynamically adding `square-round` and `big-round` formats to exclusion lists within `getBestImageV2` based on the desired aspect ratio. This indicates a continuous effort to optimize and accurately select images.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **February 2, 2026 (afternoon):** Initial development of core UI components (`mediaInfo`, `keyboard`, `sideMenu`, `usersScreen`), foundational platform interaction (`gateway`, `generic.js`), and rapid iteration on user entry/exit logic via global flags.
*   **February 4, 2026 (late morning to early afternoon):** Intensive development and iteration on row item components (`roundItem`, `genericRow`, `roundRow`) and the fixed focus indicator, with a strong emphasis on implementing and refining kid-mode specific styling and layout adjustments. This period also saw the introduction and refinement of the `ExternalContentModal`.
*   **February 5, 2026 (morning):** Fine-tuning of image utility functions, specifically regarding allowed and disallowed image formats based on context, and updates to Tizen application configuration. A notable functional change was the **disabling of keyboard event throttling and media player rewind/fast-forward functionality** in `generic.js`.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Kid-Mode Specialization:** There's a consistent pattern of developing and refining features and styles specifically for a "kid-mode" profile. This includes conditional menu structures, user selection options, content filtering, and extensive use of `styles.kids.scss` files that apply distinct color palettes (e.g., light purple, bright purple, kid-white) and design rules to various UI elements and focus indicators.
2.  **Custom Navigation and Focus System:** Many components interact with a custom `nav` object and `fixedFocus` mechanism, indicating a bespoke navigation system tailored for Smart TV input methods. `registerFocusAction`/`unregisterFocusAction` and `data-nav-fixed-focus-shape`, `data-group`, `data-block-focus-*` attributes are frequently used across UI components to manage focus behavior.
3.  **Global State Flags for App Flow:** The repeated introduction and modification of global `window` properties like `__isEntry` and `__foceEntry` in `UsersScreen` and `goBackHistory.js` highlights a need to carefully manage the application's entry points and back navigation behavior, likely for specific Smart TV lifecycle requirements or onboarding flows.
4.  **Platform Adaptability:** Code bases (`app.js`, `generic.js`, `Page`, `config.xml`) demonstrate explicit checks and adaptations for different Smart TV platforms such as WebOS, Tizen, and HbbTV, indicating a multi-platform development strategy.
5.  **Dynamic Image Handling:** The `libs/img.js` file shows a sophisticated system for fetching and optimizing images based on resolution, aspect ratio, and specific formats. Frequent adjustments to `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` and dynamic format exclusions within `getBestImageV2` suggest ongoing refinement for visual quality and performance.
6.  **Iterative UI/UX Refinement:** Numerous changes across styling files (`.scss`) and React components with rapid, sometimes back-and-forth, modifications point to an active and iterative process of refining the application's user interface and experience.
7.  **Frequent Saves:** The log contains several consecutive entries for the same file with no discernible code changes, suggesting developers were frequently saving their work, possibly using an IDE's auto-save feature or making minor non-functional adjustments.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\3cat_pro\gateway\js\app.js (2/2/2026, 14:16:27):
The `init` function has been updated to determine the `connectionmanager` service URL based on the `sdkVersion` of the WebOS device. It now uses `PALM_MANAGER` for `sdkVersion < 300` and `WEBOS_MANAGER` otherwise. The `REMOTE` URL is also conditionally set to `https://smartv-pro.3cat.website/` for `sdkVersion < 350`. The script checks for internet connectivity and redirects the `window.location.href` to the `REMOTE` URL with a `?pr=true` query parameter if connected. If not connected, it shows an alert and sets up a `keydown` listener to handle `VK_BACK` for `webOS.platformBack()`. A subscription to `getStatus` is added to monitor network changes and redirect once the connection is available.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\infoGroup\index.jsx (2/2/2026, 16:31:34):
This file introduces `EpisodeCount` and `SeasonsCount` components for displaying episode and season counts, with `EpisodeCount` conditionally rendering based on `LIVE_REFRESH_INTERVAL`. A commented-out `Publication` component indicates a removed "A partir del" functionality (JIRA CCMA-2104). The `renderSeasonOrEpisodeCount` function now handles displaying season or episode counts based on `item` properties. The `showExpiration` function calculates and displays a "Disponible fins a l'/al [date]" message if an `unpublished_on` date is within three months. Several conditional rendering logic updates for `MediaTag` and `MediaTitle` components have been made, particularly for live streams, external content, and upcoming events. The `dotSeparatedItems` array, used for rendering information, has been simplified by removing `showPublication`. The `useExternalEmission` hook is utilized for `isLiveExternal` and `whiteTagText` properties.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\mediaInfo\mediaTitle\styles.scss (2/2/2026, 16:33:36):
Minor style adjustments were made for the `.mediaTitle` component, specifically updating font-weight and font-size for various states like `.title_program`, `.live`, `.isLive_or_upcoming_event`, `.stream`, and `.menu_detail`. The `.external` style also received a `font-size` adjustment.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\portraitItem\styles.scss (2/2/2026, 16:39:57):
This CSS file received updates to its `.portraitItem` styles. A key addition is styling for `.platform-logo` and its children (`.externalLogo`, `.externalIcon`) for displaying external platform information. Focus and hover states for `.portraitItem` were also refined, including `box-shadow` and `border/outline` properties.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\keyboard\styles.scss (2/2/2026, 16:56:08):
This stylesheet defines the visual appearance of a keyboard component. It sets up a flex column layout for the `.keyboard`, centers `.keyboard-row` items, and styles individual `.keyboard-key` elements. Key styling includes background, color, font size, border-radius, and dimensions. Specific styles for `SMALL`, `MEDIUM`, and `LARGE` keys are defined, along with background images for `BACKSPACE`, `SPACE_BAR`, and `RETURN` icons. A `.focused` state is introduced with a distinct box-shadow and border color.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js (2/2/2026, 17:08:44):
The `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartTV` function was updated. It now prevents default event behavior for `keydown` events (`e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation();`). It also introduces a throttle mechanism (`THROTTLE_MS`) to limit key event processing frequency. The `PLAYER_KEYS` set is now checked before processing player-related keycodes, and `ajsrConsole` logging statements have been commented out.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\keyboard\styles.scss (2/2/2026, 17:09:25):
A new `:hover` style was added to `.keyboard-key` elements, making them visually react with a box-shadow and a red border, identical to the existing `.focused` style, when a mouse hovers over them.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\index.jsx (2/2/2026, 17:36:09):
The `SideMenu` component received several updates. The `AppMenuCreate` function is explicitly called to ensure `window.AppMenu.vars` is initialized. `useEffect` hooks were adjusted for menu navigation and user state changes, including `isMenuVisible` initialization, `nav.focusById` logic, and dynamic menu data generation based on `activeUser` type (kid or adult). A `refreshSelectedOption` function was refined to handle menu item selection and path normalization, incorporating a new `attachSearchAtTheBeginning` function for adding a search option to the L1 menu. `hideMenuLayerOver` was updated to restore focus more robustly. Navigation functions like `openLevel2Menu`, `exitMenu`, `manageFocused`, `fnDoChangeUser`, `fnExitApp`, `navigateTo`, `openUserMenu`, and `openExploraMenu` were updated to enhance menu behavior, focus management, and user interaction, especially around user switching and application exit. Mouseover events were also added for user and explora menus to trigger opening.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\sideMenu\index.jsx (2/2/2026, 17:36:22):
No functional changes are apparent in this commit; the code is identical to the previous entry, suggesting a re-save or a merge without modifications. The timestamp indicates a very rapid sequence of operations.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\onboarding\usersScreen\index.jsx (2/2/2026, 17:45:11):
This file initializes `window.__isEntry` from `location.state?.isEntry || false`. It includes a commented-out line `//if (isLoading) exitKidMode();` in the `useEffect` hook. The `PageHead` component's `onBackClick` prop is conditionally set to `window.AppGlobal.Actions.openExitAppModal` if `window.__isEntry` is true.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\onboarding\usersScreen\index.jsx (2/2/2026, 18:04:11):
The `onBackClick` prop for `PageHead` is now unconditionally set to `window.AppGlobal.Actions.openExitAppModal`, removing the `window.__isEntry` condition. The commented-out `//if (isLoading) exitKidMode();` remains unchanged.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\onboarding\usersScreen\index.jsx (2/2/2026, 18:04:19):
The commented-out line `//if (isLoading) exitKidMode();` was uncommented to `if (isLoading) exitKidMode();`. This means the `exitKidMode` function will now be called when the component is loading.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\onboarding\usersScreen\index.jsx (2/2/2026, 18:05:22):
No functional changes are apparent in this commit; the code is identical to the previous entry, suggesting a re-save or a merge without modifications.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\onboarding\usersScreen\index.jsx (2/2/2026, 18:05:33):
The initialization of `window.__isEntry` has changed from `location.state?.isEntry || false` to a hardcoded `true`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\onboarding\usersScreen\index.jsx (2/2/2026, 18:06:13):
The `location` object is now commented out, and `window.__isEntry` is no longer initialized from `location.state?.isEntry`. The `onBackClick` prop for `PageHead` remains `window.AppGlobal.Actions.openExitAppModal`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\onboarding\usersScreen\index.jsx (2/2/2026, 18:06:49):
The `location` object is now uncommented, but `window.__isEntry` remains hardcoded to `true` with the original `location.state?.isEntry || false` commented out.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\onboarding\usersScreen\index.jsx (2/2/2026, 18:09:47):
The initialization of `window.__isEntry` has been reverted to `location.state?.isEntry || false`, undoing the hardcoded `true` change.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\onboarding\usersScreen\index.jsx (2/2/2026, 18:10:38):
The `location` object is commented out again, and `window.__isEntry` is now explicitly set to `true` within a `useEffect` hook, which runs once after the initial render.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\onboarding\usersScreen\index.jsx (2/2/2026, 18:14:59):
The `window.__isEntry = true;` from the `useEffect` has been removed. Instead, a new `useEffect` hook now sets `window.__foceEntry = true;` on mount and `window.__foceEntry = false;` on unmount, indicating a new mechanism for tracking "forced entry" into the app.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\utils\goBackHistory.js (2/2/2026, 18:15:16):
The `goBackHistory` function now includes two new conditions for directly calling `callBackFunc()`: `window.__isEntry` and `window.__foceEntry`. This means if either of these global flags are true, the callback function is executed without attempting to go back in history.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx (2/2/2026, 18:50:50):
The `App` component defines the main application structure, routing, and context providers. It initializes platform-specific functionalities, handles debug console setup, and displays build information based on `appConfig`. The `AppInner` component manages navigation, user authentication, and exit/logout modals. Key updates include the conditional redirection logic for `PlatformRedirect` (HbbTV vs. welcome screen) and the handling of `ModalTypes.EXIT` which now checks `activeUser?.type === UserType.KID` to potentially navigate to the users screen instead of exiting the application. The `DidomiProvider` now opens the exit dialog via `setExitModal(ModalTypes.EXIT)`. Router configuration for public and private routes is also detailed.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx (2/2/2026, 18:50:56):
No functional changes are apparent in this commit; the code is identical to the previous entry, suggesting a re-save or a merge without modifications.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx (2/2/2026, 18:51:35):
The `openExitAppModal` function had its modal visibility and focus setting logic commented out. Specifically, `window.isUserModalVisible = true; nav.storedFocus = nav.getCurrentId(); setExitModal(ModalTypes.EXIT);` are now commented, preventing the exit modal from being shown directly through this action.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx (2/2/2026, 18:52:39):
The `openExitAppModal` function now includes `window.AppMenu.manageFocused?.();` after `window.AppMenu?.exitMenu?.();`. The previously commented-out lines for showing the exit modal are still commented.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx (2/2/2026, 18:54:07):
The `openExitAppModal` function now re-enables the previously commented-out lines for showing the exit modal: `window.isUserModalVisible = true; nav.storedFocus = nav.getCurrentId(); setExitModal(ModalTypes.EXIT);`. This restores the functionality of displaying the exit confirmation modal. The `window.AppMenu.manageFocused?.();` line added in the previous commit has been removed.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.jsx (2/2/2026, 19:14:36):
No functional changes are apparent in this commit; the code is identical to the previous entry, suggesting a re-save or a merge without modifications.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\build_templates\tizen\3cat_pro\config.xml (3/2/2026, 13:24:24):
The `widget` element's `id` has been changed from `http://tizen.qa.ccma.cat` to `http://tizen.tv3.ccma.cat.qa`. Similarly, the `tizen:application` element's `id` and `package` attributes were updated from `PzkKxRdFT6qa.TV3` and `PzkKxRdFT6qa` to `PzkKxRdFT6.TV3.qa` and `PzkKxRdFT6qa` respectively, indicating a potential change in the application identifier for the Tizen platform, possibly for a specific QA environment. The version remains `3.4.6`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx (4/2/2026, 11:36:24):
The `RoundItem` component has been updated to consider `isKidsProfile` when selecting an image format. If `isKidsProfile` is true, it attempts to find an image with `image_format === 'round'`. Otherwise, it prioritizes `'round'` and then `'logo'` image formats. The `className` for the `div` also dynamically includes `'round-image'` based on the `type` of image (round or kids-round). The `style` attribute for the `img` tag also reflects this conditional logic for `maxWidth`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx (4/2/2026, 11:41:47):
This update modifies the `RoundItem` component to handle image selection for `isKidsProfile`. When `isKidsProfile` is true, it specifically looks for an image with `image_format === 'round'`. If not in kids' profile, it looks for `'round'` and then defaults to `'logo'` format if `'round'` is not found. The `className` and `img` styles are adjusted based on the resolved image `type` (either `'round'` or `'kids-round'`).

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\rowUtils.js (4/2/2026, 12:01:27):
The `getRowkind` function now includes `square-mini` as a condition for returning `'ROUND'` row type, in addition to `'round'`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\rowUtils.js (4/2/2026, 12:01:36):
The `getRowkind` function's condition for returning `'ROUND'` has been updated to specifically check for `rowData.format === 'square_mini'`, replacing the previous `square-mini`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx (4/2/2026, 12:02:26):
The `getRowElement` function now includes `SQUARE_MINI` as a case, which also returns `SquareItem`. Similarly, `getShowAllElementsFocusShape` also maps `SQUARE_MINI` to `'square'`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx (4/2/2026, 12:08:06):
The `RoundItem` component's image selection logic for `isKidsProfile` has changed. Instead of looking for `image_format === 'round'`, it now specifically searches for `image_format === 'big-round'` when `isKidsProfile` is true. The rest of the logic remains the same.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx (4/2/2026, 12:21:39):
The `RoundItem` component's image selection logic has been reverted. The `isKidsProfile` condition, which looked for `'big-round'` images, has been removed from the `useMemo` hook that determines the `image` and `type`. Now, it consistently searches for `'round'` images first, then `'logo'`, regardless of the `isKidsProfile` prop. Consequently, the `className` and `img` style logic related to `type === 'kids-round'` has been simplified to only `type === 'round'`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.kids.scss (4/2/2026, 12:22:36):
This file introduces `.kid-mode .roundElement` styles, which initially commented out `background-color`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.kids.scss (4/2/2026, 12:22:48):
The `background-color` for `.kid-mode .roundElement` has been uncommented and set to `$base-color-3cat-kid-bright-purple`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.kids.scss (4/2/2026, 12:23:43):
A `border` property, `5px solid $base-color-3cat-kid-bright-purple !important`, was added to the `.kid-mode .roundElement` style.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.kids.scss (4/2/2026, 12:25:30):
The `border` property previously added to `.kid-mode .roundElement` has been removed. Only the `background-color` remains.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.kids.scss (4/2/2026, 12:26:49):
This file introduces specific styling for `.kid-mode .fixed-focus .inner`. It sets a `box-shadow`, `border-color`, `border`, and `outline` using kid-friendly purple colors. A commented-out section for `.round` focus styles is also present.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\index.jsx (4/2/2026, 12:27:53):
The `RoundRow` component now receives an `isKidsProfile` prop and uses it to conditionally set the `textAlign` style of the `roundItemWrapper` to `'center'` when in kids' profile, otherwise `'left'`. It also passes the `isKidsProfile` prop down to the `RoundItem` component.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\styles.scss (4/2/2026, 12:28:04):
The `height` property of `.round_row` was explicitly set to `200px + 70px`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\styles.kids.scss (4/2/2026, 12:30:18):
A commented-out style for `.kid-mode .round_row` `height` has been added.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\index.jsx (4/2/2026, 12:30:58):
The import for `./styles.kids.scss` was removed from `RoundRow`. The component no longer relies on kid-specific styles directly in its JSX logic for `textAlign` and removes the `isKidsProfile` prop being passed to `RoundItem`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.kids.scss (4/2/2026, 12:33:20):
The `_outline`, `border`, and `outline` properties for `.kid-mode .fixed-focus .inner` have been removed, leaving only `box-shadow` and `border-color` defined. The commented-out `.round` section remains.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.kids.scss (4/2/2026, 12:35:24):
The `_outline`, `border`, and `outline` properties for `.kid-mode .fixed-focus .inner` have been re-added, reverting to their previous state.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.kids.scss (4/2/2026, 12:35:49):
The `_outline`, `border`, and `outline` properties for `.kid-mode .fixed-focus .inner` have been removed again.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.kids.scss (4/2/2026, 12:37:39):
The `.kid-mode .fixed-focus .inner` style now includes an explicit `outline: 3px solid #be2649;`. Additionally, a new `.round` nested style has been added within `.fixed-focus` specifically for kid-mode, defining `width`, `height`, `box-shadow`, and `border`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.kids.scss (4/2/2026, 12:37:59):
The `outline` property for `.kid-mode .fixed-focus .inner` has been updated to `$base-color-3cat-kid-light-purple;` and a new `outline: 0px;` has been added to `.kid-mode .fixed-focus.round .inner`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.kids.scss (4/2/2026, 12:42:40):
The `outline` property for `.kid-mode .fixed-focus.round .inner` has been removed, reverting to its commented-out state, and the `outline` for `.kid-mode .fixed-focus .inner` has been updated to `3px solid $base-color-3cat-kid-light-purple;`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.kids.scss (4/2/2026, 12:43:30):
The `outline` property for `.kid-mode .fixed-focus .inner` has been removed, and the `_outline`, `border`, and `outline` properties have been restored. The `.round` style remains defined.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.kids.scss (4/2/2026, 12:44:18):
The `_outline`, `border`, and `outline` properties for `.kid-mode .fixed-focus .inner` have been removed. The `outline` for `.kid-mode .fixed-focus .inner` is now `3px solid $base-color-3cat-kid-light-purple;` and for `.kid-mode .fixed-focus.round .inner` it is `0px`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\styles.scss (4/2/2026, 12:48:42):
New styles were added for `.rowType_SQUARE_MINI` including a `.roundItemTitle` with specific font, color, and text properties. The `.item-show-all` styles were expanded to include `width`, `height`, and `margin` adjustments for `&.LANDSCAPE`, `&.PORTRAIT`, `&.PORTRAIT_MINI`, `&.SQUARE`, and `&.SQUARE_MINI` types, and `top`/`left` adjustments for the `.show-all-icon` within these types.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx (4/2/2026, 12:49:54):
The `GenericRow` component now renders a `roundItemTitle` conditionally at the end of the row if `isKidsProfile` is true.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\genericRow\index.jsx (4/2/2026, 12:54:35):
No functional changes are apparent in this commit; the code is identical to the previous entry, suggesting a re-save or a merge without modifications.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\index.jsx (4/2/2026, 12:56:05):
The `isKidsProfile` prop has been removed from the `RoundRow` component, both from its destructuring and from the props passed to `RoundItem`. The `textAlign` style for `roundItemWrapper` is now unconditionally `'left'`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx (4/2/2026, 12:56:53):
The `isKidsProfile` prop was removed from the `RoundItem` component's destructuring, from the `useMemo` hook, and from the `className` and `img` `style` attributes. The image selection logic now solely depends on `'round'` and `'logo'` image formats.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\index.jsx (4/2/2026, 12:57:05):
The `isKidsProfile` prop has been entirely removed from the `RoundRow` component and its internal logic.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx (4/2/2026, 13:25:55):
The `Page` component has undergone significant updates. The `filterChildren` function now includes additional logic to filter out content based on platform capabilities (`isLiveSupportedRef.current`, `isShakaPlayerSupportedRef.current`), external content on `hbbtv`, and `user_row` for kid profiles (`UserType.KID`). New `useEffect` hooks were added to manage `isLiveSupportedRef` and `isShakaPlayerSupportedRef` based on context changes, and to handle `menu:navigate` and `evChangeUser` events for resetting virtualization, page data, and fixed focus states. The component also now initializes `hasRefreshed.current`, `homeDataRef.current`, and `nav.fixedFocus.isNavigating` on mount.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\index.jsx (4/2/2026, 13:26:44):

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\index.jsx (4/2/2026, 13:35:58):
The `RoundRow` component now takes an `isBigRound` prop. This prop is used to conditionally set the `textAlign` of the `roundItemWrapper` to `'center'` and is passed down to the `RoundItem` component. Additionally, a `roundItemTitle` is conditionally rendered below the `RoundItem` if `isBigRound` is true.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\index.jsx (4/2/2026, 13:38:35):
The `RoundRow` component's root `div` now dynamically sets its class to `biground_row` if `isBigRound` is true, otherwise it defaults to `round_row`. The rest of the logic remains the same as the previous version.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\styles.scss (4/2/2026, 13:40:37):
New styles were added: `.round_row` has a fixed height, and `.biground_row` has a different fixed height. Common styles for both `round_row` and `biground_row` were grouped, including padding, position, width, margin, and styles for `row-title`, `row-content`, `roundItemWrapper`, and `roundItemTitle`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\rows\roundRow\index.jsx (4/2/2026, 13:42:39):

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx (4/2/2026, 13:44:19):
The `RoundItem` component has been modified to introduce an `isKidsProfile` prop. This prop now influences the image selection logic: if `isKidsProfile` is true, it specifically looks for images with `image_format === 'round'`. Otherwise, it falls back to the existing logic of prioritizing `'round'` then `'logo'` formats. The `className` and `img` styles are also updated to reflect this `isKidsProfile` condition.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx (4/2/2026, 13:44:59):
The `RoundItem` component's `isKidsProfile` prop has been replaced with `isBigRound`. This new prop now controls whether the `useMemo` hook searches for a `big-round` image format (if `isBigRound` is true) or defaults to `round` then `logo` formats. The `className` and `img` styles now also respond to `type === 'big-round'` in addition to `type === 'round'`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx (4/2/2026, 13:45:13):
A typo was corrected in the `className` attribute from `type === '-round'` to `type === 'big-round'`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx (4/2/2026, 13:48:20):
The `RoundItem` component's image selection logic has been updated. If `isBigRound` is true, it now specifically searches for an image with `image_format === 'big-round'`. Otherwise, it prioritizes `round` and then `logo` formats. The `className` and `img` styles continue to adapt to `type === 'round'` or `type === 'big-round'`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.scss (4/2/2026, 13:53:09):
New styles for `.biground_row .roundElement` were introduced, setting `width`, `height`, and `margin-right`. This also included specific styling for `.biground_row .roundElement.round-image` for its `width` and `height`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.kids.scss (4/2/2026, 13:54:47):
The `.kid-mode .roundElement` style now includes a `border: 5px solid $base-color-3cat-kid-bright-purple !important;` in addition to its `background-color`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\index.jsx (4/2/2026, 14:01:29):
The `RoundItem` component now dynamically sets the `data-nav-fixed-focus-shape` attribute to either `'bigRound'` (if `isBigRound` is true) or `'round'` based on the `isBigRound` prop.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.scss (4/2/2026, 14:02:04):
A new focus shape, `&.bigRound`, has been added to `.fixed-focus` styles. This style defines `width`, `height`, `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, `border`, and `outline` properties similar to the existing `&.round` style.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.scss (4/2/2026, 14:02:35):
The `width`, `height`, `box-shadow`, and `border` properties of `&.bigRound` within `.fixed-focus .inner` were updated. The `box-shadow` and `border` colors now use `$base-color-3cat-kid-light-purple`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.kids.scss (4/2/2026, 14:02:51):
The `outline: 0px;` for `.kid-mode .fixed-focus.round .inner` has been removed.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.kids.scss (4/2/2026, 14:06:31):
The `outline` property for `.kid-mode .fixed-focus .inner` has been removed, reverting to previous style.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.scss (4/2/2026, 14:09:26):
The `.page .fixed-focus` styles were updated. The `top` and `left` properties for `.page &.round, &.bigRound` were grouped together under the same rule.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\items\rowItems\roundItem\styles.kids.scss (4/2/2026, 14:12:14):
The `border` property previously added to `.kid-mode .roundElement` has been removed, leaving only the `background-color`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.kids.scss (4/2/2026, 14:14:22):
New styles for `.kid-mode .fixed-focus &.round, &.big-round .inner` were added, setting their `outline` to `0px`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.kids.scss (4/2/2026, 14:14:40):
The new style for `.kid-mode .fixed-focus &.round, &.big-round .inner` introduced in the previous commit had its selector corrected to `.kid-mode .fixed-focus &.round, &.bigRound .inner` to match the `bigRound` class name.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\App.kids.scss (4/2/2026, 14:18:09):
A new style has been added for `.kid-mode .V-SCROLLABLE:not(.fixed) .focused`. This style applies a `box-shadow`, `border-color`, and `outline` using `$base-color-3cat-kid-light-purple` for focused elements within scrollable areas in kid mode.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.scss (4/2/2026, 14:26:06):
The `box-shadow` and `border` colors for `.fixed-focus &.bigRound .inner` were changed from `$base-color-3cat-kid-light-purple` to `$base-color-3cat-kid-white`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\fixedFocus\fixedFocus.scss (4/2/2026, 14:26:27):
The `box-shadow` and `border` properties for `.fixed-focus &.bigRound .inner` now use `!important` to ensure their values are applied.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\index.jsx (4/2/2026, 15:12:08):
The `ExternalContentModal` component has been refined. It now uses `item.external_type` to determine the modal `type`. The `imgData` memoization now includes `['modal-portrait', 'portrait']` as `forceFormat`. `isPartner` is derived from `item.collection === 'partner'`, and the `platformLogoContainer` is conditionally rendered only if `!isPartner`. The `platformTextRow` now handles splitting `platformText` by periods to display it across two lines if multiple parts exist. Button props for `blockMovementLeft`, `blockMovementDown`, and `blockMovementUp` have been added to the "Open External" button, and `blockMovementRight`, `blockMovementDown`, and `blockMovementUp` for the "Continue in 3Cat" button.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\styles.scss (4/2/2026, 15:15:02):
New styles were introduced for `.externalPopup .popupLeft.partner` to adjust its height to `428px`. The `.platformLogoContainer` within `.popupLeft` also received positioning adjustments (`top: 544px`). The `.platformTextRow .platformTextWrapper` now has `flex-direction: column` and `width: 715px`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\index.jsx (4/2/2026, 15:15:17):
The `popupLeft` div now dynamically applies the `partner` class if `isPartner` is true.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\externalContentModal\index.jsx (4/2/2026, 15:17:01):
The `generateImageData` call within the `useMemo` hook for `imgData` now conditionally sets the `height` parameter to `428` if `isPartner` is true, otherwise it remains `544`. The `isPartner` dependency was also added to the `useMemo` array.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\libs\img.js (5/2/2026, 9:38:25):
The `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` array has a duplicate `'round'` entry. The `getBestImageV2` function now adds `square-round` and `portrait-english` to its `notAllowedFomats` array when `desiredAspect` is `'LANDSCAPE'`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\libs\img.js (5/2/2026, 9:38:51):
The `getBestImageV2` function's `notAllowedFomats` array now includes `'square-round'` when the `desiredAspect` is `'LANDSCAPE'`. Previously, `'square-round'` was already added to the `notAllowedFomats` within the `getBestImageV2` function, but this change explicitly adds it again in the `LANDSCAPE` condition.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\libs\img.js (5/2/2026, 9:40:12):
No functional changes are apparent in this commit; the code is identical to the previous entry, suggesting a re-save or a merge without modifications.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\libs\img.js (5/2/2026, 9:40:33):
The `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` array now explicitly lists `'square-round'` once, resolving the previous duplicate `'round'` and adding `'square-round'` to the global list.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\libs\img.js (5/2/2026, 9:44:04):
The `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS` array has been modified, removing `'square-round'`. However, `getBestImageV2` still adds `'square-round'` and a new `'big-round'` to its local `notAllowedFomats` array when the `desiredAspect` is `'LANDSCAPE'`.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\libs\img.js (5/2/2026, 9:46:50):
The `removeItemsFromArray` function's internal comment `//return array.filter((item) => !items.includes(item.image_format));` has been updated to reflect the actual functional code, which is identical. The `getBestImage` function also had its internal comment for `removeItemsFromArray` updated. No functional changes.

c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js (5/2/2026, 13:32:40):
The `onKeyDownHandler` function now omits `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` for player-related keys (VK_PLAY, VK_PAUSE, etc.) specifically for WebOS, Tizen, and other non-HbbTV platforms. Previously these were applied generally. This allows for native player controls to potentially handle these key events without interference from the app. The throttling mechanism was also commented out (`//if (now - lastTs < THROTTLE_MS) return;`).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Timestamps:** Most changes occurred on 2/2/2026, suggesting a concentrated development effort or a single day's work. Several rapid-fire commits (e.g., `App.jsx`, `usersScreen/index.jsx`, `fixedFocus.kids.scss`, `img.js`) with identical code indicate frequent saving or version control operations without significant functional changes between them.
*   **Kids' Profile / Kid-mode:** There's a strong recurring theme of implementing or adjusting features for a "kid-mode" or "kids' profile." This includes:
    *   Conditional logic in `SideMenu` for `settingsData.child_menu`.
    *   `UsersScreen` managing `setKidUser` and `exitKidMode`.
    *   `Page` filtering rows and content based on `activeUser?.type === UserType.KID`.
    *   Conditional `textAlign` in `RoundRow` and `isKidsProfile` prop in `RoundItem`.
    *   Dedicated `styles.kids.scss` files for `RoundItem`, `fixedFocus`, and `App`, defining specific visual styles (e.g., purple colors, different focus outlines) for kid mode.
*   **Focus Management and Navigation:** Many changes are related to UI focus and keyboard navigation, particularly in smart TV environments:
    *   `registerFocusAction`, `unregisterFocusAction` are used frequently across components like `RoundItem` and `GenericRow`.
    *   `nav.focusById` is extensively used to programmatically control focus.
    *   `data-block-focus-up`, `data-block-focus-right`, `data-block-focus-left`, `data-on-lost-left-action` attributes are present in many focusable elements to define navigation behavior.
    *   `fixedFocus` styles and logic are repeatedly adjusted, including the introduction of `bigRound` shape.
*   **Platform Specificity:** The code frequently includes conditional logic based on `window.AppGlobal.platform` (e.g., `webos`, `tizen`, `hbbtv`) for keyboard handling, connection managers, and content filtering.
*   **Image Handling:** The `src\libs\img.js` file shows ongoing refinement of image selection and processing logic (`getBestImage`, `getBestImageV2`), including `IMGPROXY_PRESETS` and `NOT_ALLOWED_FORMATS`. New formats like `'square-round'` and `'big-round'` are being considered or added.
*   **Modal Management:** Several files (`App.jsx`, `ExternalContentModal`) deal with opening, closing, and handling different types of modals (`ExitAppModal`, `ExternalContentModal`).
*   **Code Comments:** There are instances of `TODO`, `JIRA` ticket references (e.g., `CCMA-2104`, `CCMA-1685`), and commented-out code, indicating ongoing development, feature changes, and potential future work.
