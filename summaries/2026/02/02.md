# Activity Summary for 2/2/2026

## 0:19:28
The code changes log outlines a focused development session on January 30, 2026, primarily concerning user input, navigation, and consent management across a Smart TV application project.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\styles.scss` (Timestamp: 30/1/2026, 9:04:15)**
    *   This file defines foundational styles for a `page_view` element, setting its absolute positioning, full 1920x1080px dimensions, and a background image (`3cat_red-bg_1920x270.png`). It also includes styling for a `.rankingText` within the page and a fixed `bottom-gradient` element with its own background image (`mask_1080.png`). The background images suggest a visual design specific to the "3cat" branding.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (Timestamps: 30/1/2026, 11:38:08 to 12:29:26)**
    *   This file, critical for keyboard navigation across various Smart TV platforms, underwent several iterative changes.
    *   **Core functionality:** It establishes a `window.AppGlobal.KeyMemory` system to detect and act upon key combinations (e.g., "979899" to enable ads, "999897" to disable ads). It handles a wide range of keyboard inputs, including navigation (Up, Down, Left, Right), Enter, and Back/Exit keys, with specific key codes mapped for PC browsers, Samsung Tizen, LG WebOS, and Hisense.
    *   **Platform-specific enhancements:** Initially, `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartTV` provided distinct key handling for WebOS and Tizen.
        *   An update at **11:53:37** introduced explicit handling for a `PLAY_PAUSE` key for WebOS, utilizing `window.KeyEvent?.VK_PLAY_PAUSE` or a fallback hexadecimal code.
        *   Subsequent updates at **12:29:17** and **12:29:26** refactored player control calls, transitioning from `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller.play/pause` to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.play/pause` for WebOS and Tizen, standardizing the API for media playback actions.
    *   The `dispatchFastForwardEvent` and `dispatchRewindEvent` functions are defined with a minor syntax error (`return const event...` instead of `return; const event...`).

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\keycodes.js` (Timestamp: 30/1/2026, 11:54:49)**
    *   This file defines a `KeyCodes` object specifically for the HbbTV platform. It maps human-readable key names (like `VK_LEFT`, `VK_RED`, `VK_PLAY`, numeric keys) to their corresponding hexadecimal or decimal key codes. It employs optional chaining (`window.KeyEvent?.VK_KEY_NAME`) with a fallback mechanism to ensure compatibility.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\hbbtv.js` (Timestamps: 30/1/2026, 11:55:42 to 12:33:41)**
    *   This file manages the HbbTV application lifecycle and its keyboard interactions.
    *   **Application Initialization:** `initAppHbbTV` logs device information, and sets up an event listener (`evExitApplication`) to gracefully destroy the HbbTV application.
    *   **Keyboard Navigation:** `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartHbbTV` configures the HbbTV application's key handling by registering a keyset mask, enabling navigation, VCR controls (Play, Pause, Stop, Rewind, Fast Forward), and color buttons.
    *   **Player Actions Refinement:**
        *   Initially, player controls (Play, Pause, Stop, Rewind, Fast Forward) directed to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` methods.
        *   An update at **12:29:39** aligned these actions with the `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` interface, consistent with the `generic.js` changes.
        *   A final refinement at **12:33:41** altered the Rewind and Fast Forward key handling to dispatch custom events (`dispatchRewindEvent`, `dispatchFastForwardEvent`) rather than directly calling `Player.Actions.seek...` methods, mirroring the behavior in `generic.js` and introducing the same syntax error in the dispatch functions.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\contexts\didomiContext.jsx` (Timestamps: 30/1/2026, 12:20:04 to 12:21:34)**
    *   This React context is introduced to manage user consent via the Didomi SDK.
    *   It controls the visibility of Didomi notices/preferences and an `ExitAppModal`.
    *   It listens for specific keydown events (back/exit keys) to interact with Didomi modals or trigger the exit modal.
    *   It registers callbacks with the Didomi SDK for `notice.hidden`, `preferences.shown`, `preferences.hidden`, and various click actions.
    *   The context handles Didomi SDK initialization, including managing delays and fallbacks.
    *   An update at **12:21:34** integrated an `<ExtraAppModals/>` component within the `DidomiContext.Provider`, suggesting a centralized approach to modal management.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (Timestamp: 30/1/2026, 12:29:46)**
    *   This file provides Tizen-specific platform integrations.
    *   `initAppTizen` logs device info, attaches a `visibilitychange` listener to pause/play content and exit the app when hidden, and sets up an `evExitApplication` listener to exit the Tizen application.
    *   `initNetworkStateListener` monitors network connectivity, triggering `openModal("NO_CONNECTION")` on disconnection.
    *   `initScreenSaverHelpers` manages Tizen's screen saver, allowing it to be enabled or disabled via `webapis.appcommon.setScreenSaver`.
    *   `initExtraSamsungKeys` registers additional Samsung TV remote keys (media controls, color buttons, numeric keys) for broader input support.
    *   Functions `launchAppTizen` and `openSamsungStore` are provided for launching other Tizen applications or directing the user to the Samsung App Store.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Date Consistency:** All log entries share the exact same date, "30/1/2026", indicating that these changes were part of a concentrated development effort within a single day.
2.  **Platform Abstraction and Specialization:** There's a clear pattern of using `window.AppGlobal.platform` checks to execute platform-specific logic (WebOS, Tizen, HbbTV). While `generic.js` handles common Smart TV functionalities, dedicated files (`hbbtv.js`, `tizen.js`) provide deeper integration and unique features for their respective platforms.
3.  **Keyboard Input and Navigation Focus:** A primary theme across `generic.js` and `hbbtv.js` is the robust handling of keyboard input for navigation (directional keys, Enter) and media playback (Play, Pause, Stop, Rewind, Fast Forward). This is crucial for Smart TV applications that rely on remote controls.
4.  **Player API Standardization:** A noticeable refactoring trend is the shift from `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` methods to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` methods for controlling media playback in `generic.js` and `hbbtv.js`. This suggests an effort to create a more consistent or abstract player control interface.
5.  **Custom Event System:** The widespread use of `CustomEvent` (`customKeyDown`, `customKeyUp`, `customNavigation`, `customSeekKeyDown`) across `generic.js` and `hbbtv.js` indicates a modular design where components can react to broad application events without tight coupling.
6.  **Consent Management Integration:** The `didomiContext.jsx` file highlights the integration of a third-party consent management platform (Didomi), demonstrating a focus on privacy compliance and user experience regarding data consent.
7.  **Exit Application Logic:** The application consistently handles exit scenarios, often involving `goBackHistory`, an `openExitAppModal`, or direct application destruction (`app.destroyApplication()` for HbbTV, `tizen.application.getCurrentApplication().exit()` for Tizen).
8.  **Development/Debugging Practices:** The presence of `ajsrConsole.log` and `console.log` statements throughout the code suggests active debugging and logging, which is common during development.
9.  **Syntax Error Repetition:** The `dispatchFastForwardEvent` and `dispatchRewindEvent` functions in both `generic.js` and `hbbtv.js` consistently exhibit a syntax error (`return const event = ...`), suggesting a common origin for this code snippet that was propagated across files.

## 4:21:18
The provided log details several code changes across a Smart TV application project, primarily focusing on input handling, platform-specific integrations, and UI components.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\styles.scss` (Timestamp: 30/1/2026, 9:04:15)**:
    *   This entry introduces or fully updates the styling for a `.page_view` and a `.bottom-gradient` element. The `.page_view` includes background imagery (`3cat_red-bg_1920x270.png`), absolute positioning, and a child `.rankingText` with specific font styles. A fixed `.bottom-gradient` element uses `mask_1080.png` as its background.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js`**:
    *   **Initial state (30/1/2026, 11:38:08 & 11:38:42)**: Establishes a global keyboard navigation system (`window.AppGlobal.KeyMemory`, `window.AppGlobal.keyCombinations`) to handle various key codes. It defines key combinations for enabling/disabling ads. The `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartTV` function sets up a throttled `onKeyDownHandler` that dispatches custom events and processes common Smart TV keys (navigation, enter, back, numeric). It includes platform-specific logic for WebOS and Tizen, where player control keys (Play, Pause, Stop, Rewind, Fast Forward) initially call `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` methods for WebOS and a mix of `Player.Controller` and `Player.Actions` for Tizen.
    *   **Update (30/1/2026, 11:53:37)**: For WebOS platform-specific key handling, a new case `window.KeyEvent?.VK_PLAY_PAUSE || 0x52` was added to manage the Play/Pause key, invoking `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.togglePlayPause()`.
    *   **Update (30/1/2026, 12:29:17 & 12:29:26)**: In the WebOS platform-specific key handling, the calls for Play, Pause, and Stop keys were updated to consistently use `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.play()`, `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.pause()`, and `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.pause()` respectively, instead of `Player.Controller`. The Tizen platform-specific logic also saw `Player.Controller.play()` updated to `Player.Actions.play()`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\keycodes.js` (Timestamp: 30/1/2026, 11:54:49)**:
    *   This entry defines a `KeyCodes` object, providing a standardized set of key code constants for HbbTV, including navigation keys, color buttons, and media playback control keys (Play, Pause, Stop, Fast Forward, Rewind), often with fallbacks using `window.KeyEvent`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\hbbtv.js`**:
    *   **Initial state (30/1/2026, 11:55:42 & 11:55:54)**: Initializes the HbbTV application (`initAppHbbTV`), including device information retrieval and an event listener for `evExitApplication` to destroy the application. `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartHbbTV` sets up HbbTV-specific key registration (color keys, navigation, VCR controls) and a `handleKeyDown` function to process these keys. Player controls initially used `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` methods for play, pause, stop, and seek actions.
    *   **Update (30/1/2026, 11:56:04)**: `VK_PLAY_PAUSE` was explicitly added to the destructuring assignment of `KeyCodes` at the top of the file, formalizing its use.
    *   **Update (30/1/2026, 12:29:39)**: Player control actions within `processKey` for HbbTV were updated to use `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` methods instead of `Player.Controller` (e.g., `Player.Actions.play()`, `Player.Actions.pause()`, `Player.Actions.seekMinus10Seconds()`, `Player.Actions.seekPlus10Seconds()`).
    *   **Update (30/1/2026, 12:33:41)**: The `VK_REWIND` and `VK_FAST_FWD` cases in `processKey` were changed to call `dispatchRewindEvent()` and `dispatchFastForwardEvent()` respectively. Corresponding `dispatchFastForwardEvent` and `dispatchRewindEvent` helper functions were added to the file, aligning with the `generic.js` approach.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\contexts\didomiContext.jsx`**:
    *   **Initial state (30/1/2026, 12:20:04 & 12:20:41)**: Defines a React `DidomiContext` for managing user consent via the Didomi SDK. It handles the display and hiding of consent notices and preferences, including a `useEffect` hook to initialize Didomi listeners and handle back key presses to navigate the consent UI or close it. It also renders an `ExitAppModal`.
    *   **Update (30/1/2026, 12:21:34)**: An `<ExtraAppModals/>` component was added to be rendered within the `DidomiContext.Provider`, indicating an expansion of modal management.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (Timestamp: 30/1/2026, 12:29:46)**:
    *   This entry details the Tizen platform initialization (`initAppTizen`, `TizenDevice`). It includes fetching device information, handling application `visibilitychange` events (pausing/playing the player, exiting the app), monitoring network state (displaying a "NO_CONNECTION" modal on disconnect), managing screen saver status, and registering a comprehensive set of extra Samsung TV remote keys (media controls, color buttons, numeric, channel up/down). It also provides functions for launching other Tizen applications and opening the Samsung Store. Player actions consistently use `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Platform-Specific Key Handling:** A dominant pattern is the detailed and segmented approach to keyboard navigation and media control across different Smart TV platforms (WebOS, Tizen, HbbTV, and generic). Each platform has dedicated files or conditional blocks to manage its specific key codes and application behaviors.
2.  **Player Action Abstraction:** There's a consistent refactoring trend, particularly between 11:53:37 and 12:29:39, to move player control calls from `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` methods to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` methods across `generic.js` and `hbbtv.js`. This suggests a shift towards a more unified and abstracted player control interface.
3.  **Custom Event System:** The application widely uses `CustomEvent` (e.g., `customKeyDown`, `customNavigation`, `customSeekKeyDown`) to dispatch actions and state changes, promoting a decoupled architecture.
4.  **Back Key Handling:** The "Back" key (various key codes like 8, 88, 461, 10009, `VK_BACK`) is handled consistently across `generic.js`, `hbbtv.js`, and `didomiContext.jsx` to manage application history, close modals, or trigger application exit procedures, including integration with the Didomi consent flow.
5.  **Ad Management via Key Combinations:** `generic.js` explicitly defines key combinations to enable or disable ads through `window.AppGlobal.Player.Ads.enabedAds()` and `disabledAds()`.
6.  **Initialization and Lifecycle Management:** Both `hbbtv.js` and `tizen.js` contain `initApp...` functions and event listeners (e.g., `evExitApplication`, `visibilitychange`) that manage the application's lifecycle, including exiting the app and handling background/foreground states.
7.  **Consent Management (Didomi):** The `didomiContext.jsx` file illustrates a robust integration with the Didomi SDK for consent collection, managing its UI visibility and user interaction flow.

## 9:23:19
The code changes primarily focus on implementing and refining keyboard navigation and application behavior across different Smart TV platforms (general, HbbTV, Tizen), alongside integrating a consent management system (Didomi). All changes occurred on **30/1/2026**.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\styles.scss` (Timestamp: 9:04:15):**
    *   Defines core styling for a `page_view` element, setting its background image (`3cat_red-bg_1920x270.png`), position, and dimensions.
    *   Includes styling for a `rankingText` within `page_view` and a `bottom-gradient` using `mask_1080.png`. This appears to be a foundational style definition for a page.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js` (Multiple Timestamps):**
    *   **Initial state (Timestamp: 11:38:08):** Establishes a comprehensive keyboard navigation system (`IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartTV`) for general Smart TV platforms. It includes:
        *   Key throttling (`THROTTLE_MS = 200`).
        *   A `KeyMemory` mechanism to detect key combinations for specific actions, such as enabling/disabling ads.
        *   Handling common navigation keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, ENTER) and the 'Back' key (with specific codes for PC, Samsung Tizen, LG WebOS, Hisense). The 'Back' key also checks for `window.displayingDidomi` and `window.isUserModalVisible` before triggering `goBackHistory` or an exit modal.
        *   Basic handling for numeric keys (1, 2) to control player ads.
        *   Platform-specific `switch` cases for WebOS and Tizen to handle media keys (Play, Pause, Stop, Rewind, FastForward) using `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` for WebOS and a mix for Tizen.
        *   A general fallback for other platforms (not HbbTV) using `VK_` constants for media controls via `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions`.
    *   **Update (Timestamp: 11:53:37):** Introduced specific `VK_PLAY_PAUSE` handling for WebOS, switching to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.togglePlayPause()`.
    *   **Refactoring (Timestamp: 12:29:17):** Standardized player actions for WebOS, changing `Player.Controller.play()`/`pause()` to `Player.Actions.play()`/`pause()`. For Tizen, the 'Play' key was updated to `Player.Actions.play()`, but 'Pause' still used `Player.Controller.pause()`.
    *   **Minor saves (Timestamps: 11:38:42, 12:29:26):** These entries appear to be identical to previous commits, likely representing saves without functional changes.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\keycodes.js` (Timestamp: 11:54:49):**
    *   Defines HbbTV-specific key code mappings, using `window.KeyEvent` for standard HbbTV key codes with fallback hexadecimal or decimal values. This includes navigation, color buttons, and media control keys.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\hbbtv.js` (Multiple Timestamps):**
    *   **Initial state (Timestamp: 11:55:42):** Implements HbbTV-specific application and keyboard navigation (`IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartHbbTV`).
        *   Initializes the HbbTV application and attaches an `evExitApplication` listener to destroy the app.
        *   Registers keys with the HbbTV `keyset` mask, including color buttons, navigation, and VCR controls (Play, Pause, Stop, Rewind, FastForward).
        *   `processKey` function handles various HbbTV key codes, using `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` for most media actions, but `Player.Actions.togglePlayPause()` for `VK_PLAY_PAUSE`.
        *   Back key logic includes `goBackHistory` or `app.destroyApplication()`.
    *   **Minor save (Timestamp: 11:55:54):** Identical to the previous entry.
    *   **Enhancement (Timestamp: 11:56:04):** Added `VK_PLAY_PAUSE` to the destructured `KeyCodes` at the top of the file, making its usage in the `processKey` switch statement explicit.
    *   **Refactoring (Timestamp: 12:29:39):** Standardized player actions, changing most `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` calls to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` (e.g., `play()`, `pause()`, `seekMinus10Seconds()`, `seekPlus10Seconds()`).
    *   **Functionality addition (Timestamp: 12:33:41):** Introduced explicit definitions for `dispatchFastForwardEvent()` and `dispatchRewindEvent()` within the `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartHbbTV` scope, ensuring custom seek events are properly dispatched.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\contexts\didomiContext.jsx` (Multiple Timestamps):**
    *   **Initial state (Timestamp: 12:20:04):** Implements a React context (`DidomiContext`) for integrating the Didomi consent management platform.
        *   Manages the visibility of the Didomi notice and preferences, and an `exitModalOpened` state.

        *   Registers various Didomi SDK event listeners (`notice.hidden`, `preferences.shown`, `preferences.hidden`, click events).
        *   Includes logic for initial Didomi setup, checking if user consent needs to be collected, and displaying the notice with a delay.
    *   **Minor save (Timestamp: 12:20:41):** Identical to the previous entry.
    *   **Component Addition (Timestamp: 12:21:34):** Added an `<ExtraAppModals/>` component to the Didomi context's render output, suggesting the integration of additional modals.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js` (Timestamp: 12:29:46):**
    *   Provides comprehensive Tizen platform integration functions.

    *   Includes `initNetworkStateListener` to monitor network connectivity and trigger a "NO_CONNECTION" modal on disconnection.
    *   Implements `initScreenSaverHelpers` to control the Tizen device's screen saver functionality.
    *   `initExtraSamsungKeys` registers a wide range of Samsung TV remote keys (media, color, numeric, channel) for better control.
    *   Offers `launchAppTizen` to launch other Tizen applications and `openSamsungStore` to navigate to the Samsung app store.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Platform Abstraction:** Code is clearly divided by platform (`generic.js`, `hbbtv.js`, `tizen.js`) to handle platform-specific APIs and behaviors.
2.  **Keyboard-Driven UI:** A major theme is the robust implementation of keyboard navigation for Smart TV environments, including event throttling, custom event dispatching, and handling diverse key codes for navigation and media control.
3.  **Player API Standardization:** A noticeable refactoring trend is the move from `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` for media playback functions across `generic.js` and `hbbtv.js`, indicating an effort to unify the player interaction API.
4.  **Consent Management (Didomi):** Integration of a consent management platform is a significant feature, handling its display, user interaction via keyboard, and state management within a React context.
5.  **Exit Application Flow:** Consistent logic across platforms for handling application exit, often involving the 'Back' key and an exit modal, is present.
6.  **Extensive Logging:** Frequent use of `ajsrConsole.log` and `console.log` indicates a strong emphasis on debugging and tracing application flow across different platforms.
7.  **Key Code Definitions:** Key codes are defined in dedicated `keycodes.js` files and imported, promoting maintainability and clarity.

## 10:23:27
The code changes primarily focus on implementing and refining keyboard navigation and player controls across various Smart TV platforms (WebOS, Tizen, HbbTV), alongside updates to styling and consent management.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\styles.scss` (30/1/2026, 9:04:15):**
    *   Defines the core styling for a `.page_view`, including a background image (`3cat_red-bg_1920x270.png`) and dimensions.
    *   Establishes styles for a `rankingText` element and a fixed `.bottom-gradient` with another background image (`mask_1080.png`), indicating visual structure for a page.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js`:**
    *   **Initial implementation (30/1/2026, 11:38:08 & 11:38:42):** Introduces `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartTV` for handling keyboard events common across Smart TV platforms. This includes throttling key presses, handling basic navigation (Up, Down, Left, Right, Enter), and exit logic. It also sets up `window.AppGlobal.KeyMemory` for recognizing key combinations, notably for enabling/disabling ads. Platform-specific player controls (Play, Pause, Stop, Rewind, FastForward) are implemented for WebOS and Tizen, initially using `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` methods.
    *   **WebOS Play/Pause update (30/1/2026, 11:53:37):** Added `VK_PLAY_PAUSE` key handling for WebOS, enabling a toggle play/pause functionality using `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.togglePlayPause()`.
    *   **Player API refactor (30/1/2026, 12:29:17 & 12:29:26):** Player control calls for WebOS (Play, Pause, Stop) were refactored from `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions`. For Tizen, only the Play action was updated to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.play()`, while Pause and Stop continued to use `Controller` methods.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\keycodes.js` (30/1/2026, 11:54:49):**
    *   Defines a comprehensive `KeyCodes` object for HbbTV, mapping standard TV remote buttons (navigation, color keys, VCR controls, numeric keys) to their respective hexadecimal or decimal codes, with fallbacks for `window.KeyEvent`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\hbbtv.js`:**
    *   **Initial implementation (30/1/2026, 11:55:42, 11:55:54 & 11:56:04):** Implements HbbTV-specific application initialization (`initAppHbbTV`, `HbbTVDevice`) and keyboard navigation (`IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartHbbTV`). It registers HbbTV remote keys and processes them, directing player actions to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` methods. The `VK_PLAY_PAUSE` key is explicitly destructured from `KeyCodes`.
    *   **Player API refactor & event dispatch (30/1/2026, 12:29:39 & 12:33:41):** All player control calls in HbbTV were refactored from `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions`. Additionally, fast forward and rewind actions were updated to dispatch custom events (`customSeekKeyDown`) rather than directly calling `Player.Actions.seek...` methods.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\contexts\didomiContext.jsx`:**
    *   **Initial implementation (30/1/2026, 12:20:04 & 12:20:41):** Introduces `DidomiContext` for managing user consent, handling the display and interaction with Didomi notices and preferences. It includes keyboard handling for back/escape keys to navigate consent modals and integrates with the Didomi SDK lifecycle.
    *   **Modal integration (30/1/2026, 12:21:34):** Integrates an `<ExtraAppModals/>` component within the `DidomiProvider`, indicating the management of additional application-level modals.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js`:**
    *   **Initial implementation (30/1/2026, 12:29:46):** Provides Tizen-specific platform features, including device information retrieval, handling application visibility changes (pausing/playing the global player), screen saver management, and extensive registration of Samsung TV remote keys. It also includes functions for launching other Tizen apps and the Samsung store. A network state listener was initially set up to open a "NO_CONNECTION" modal upon disconnection.
    *   **Network listener modification (2/2/2026, 10:19:43 & 10:20:15):** The `initNetworkStateListener` function was initially commented out, then re-enabled with a significantly streamlined implementation. It now primarily dispatches a `evNetworkDisconnected` custom event when a network gateway disconnection is detected, removing previous detailed logging and direct modal interaction.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

1.  **Platform-Specific Development:** A clear pattern of tailoring code to specific Smart TV platforms (WebOS, Tizen, HbbTV) is evident, with dedicated files and conditional logic within `generic.js`.
2.  **Keyboard and Player Control Focus:** A central theme is the robust implementation of keyboard navigation and player controls, encompassing standard remote actions and custom key combinations (e.g., for ad control).
3.  **Global Application State:** The `window.AppGlobal` object is consistently used to manage application-wide state and functionalities, including key handling, player actions, and screen saver controls.
4.  **Custom Event System:** Frequent use of `CustomEvent` (`customKeyDown`, `customNavigation`, `evExitApplication`, `evNetworkDisconnected`) indicates a reliance on a custom event-driven architecture for communication within the application.
5.  **Player API Refactoring:** A noticeable refactoring trend occurs around January 30, 2026, 12:29:xx, where player control calls are shifted from `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` across `generic.js` and `hbbtv.js`, suggesting a change or consolidation of the internal player API.
6.  **Consent Management Integration:** The integration of the Didomi SDK highlights a focus on compliance and user consent, with dedicated UI and interaction logic.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\views\page\styles.scss` (30/1/2026, 9:04:15):** This file defines the visual layout for a page view. It sets a full-screen background image (`3cat_red-bg_1920x270.png`), positions a `.rankingText` element, and creates a `.bottom-gradient` with another background image (`mask_1080.png`). This entry appears to be the initial definition of these styles.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\generic.js`:**
    *   **30/1/2026, 11:38:08 & 11:38:42:** Establishes generic keyboard navigation for Smart TVs. It defines global key memory for combinations, maps common key codes (arrows, enter, back, numbers) to navigation and player actions, and includes platform-specific handling for WebOS and Tizen. Ad enabling/disabling is also handled via specific key combinations.
    *   **30/1/2026, 11:53:37:** Refactored WebOS-specific player key handling to consistently use `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.play()` and `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.pause()`. A new case for `VK_PLAY_PAUSE` (0x52) was added for WebOS.
    *   **30/1/2026, 12:29:17 & 12:29:26:** Updated Tizen-specific play action to use `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions.play()`, though pause and stop still refer to `Controller.pause()`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\keycodes.js` (30/1/2026, 11:54:49):** Introduced a dedicated file to define HbbTV-specific key codes, using `window.KeyEvent` with fallback values for various navigation, color, and media playback keys.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\hbbtv\hbbtv.js`:**
    *   **30/1/2026, 11:55:42 & 11:55:54:** Provides HbbTV-specific application initialization and keyboard navigation. It registers keysets (color, navigation, VCR controls) with the HbbTV application manager and defines how key presses map to navigation and player controls, initially using `window.AppGlobal.Player.Controller` for seek actions.
    *   **30/1/2026, 11:56:04:** Added `VK_PLAY_PAUSE` to the destructured KeyCodes import.
    *   **30/1/2026, 12:29:39:** Standardized HbbTV player actions to `window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions` and changed rewind/fast-forward to dispatch `customSeekKeyDown` events instead of directly calling `seekMinus10Seconds()` / `seekPlus10Seconds()`.
    *   **30/1/2026, 12:33:41:** Moved the `dispatchFastForwardEvent` and `dispatchRewindEvent` helper functions into the scope of `IinitKeyboardNavigation_SmartHbbTV`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\contexts\didomiContext.jsx`:**
    *   **30/1/2026, 12:20:04 & 12:20:41:** Implements a React context (`DidomiContext`) to manage a consent notice (Didomi) and an exit application modal. It handles showing/hiding the notice, collecting user consent, and attaching a keydown listener for back/exit keys.
    *   **30/1/2026, 12:21:34:** Began rendering the `AppModals` component within the Didomi context provider.
    *   **2/2/2026, 10:25:12:** Corrected the import statement for `AppModals` from `ExtraAppModals` to `AppModals` for consistency.
    *   **2/2/2026, 10:28:16:** Introduced `handleNetworkDisconnected`, which disables the Didomi UI and removes keydown listeners upon a network disconnection event (`evNetworkDisconnected`). A corresponding event listener was added to the `useEffect` hook.
    *   **2/2/2026, 10:42:48:** Added `handleNetworkConnected`, which, if consent is pending and the notice isn't visible, attempts to display the Didomi notice when a network connection is re-established.
    *   **2/2/2026, 10:43:17:** Connected `handleNetworkConnected` to the `evNetworkConnected` custom event listener.
    *   **2/2/2026, 10:49:34:** Re-introduced explicit state resets for `displayingPreferences.current`, `hiddingPreferences.current`, and `consentShouldBeColected.current` within `handleNetworkDisconnected`.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\platform\tizen\tizen.js`:**
    *   **30/1/2026, 12:29:46:** Sets up Tizen-specific application lifecycle (visibility changes, exit), screen saver management, and registration of extra Samsung TV remote keys. It also includes an `initNetworkStateListener` that triggers an `openModal("NO_CONNECTION")` on network disconnection.
    *   **2/2/2026, 10:19:43:** The `initNetworkStateListener` function was commented out, suggesting a temporary disablement or refactoring.
    *   **2/2/2026, 10:20:15:** The `initNetworkStateListener` function was re-enabled but refactored to dispatch a `CustomEvent('evNetworkDisconnected')` instead of directly opening a modal.
    *   **2/2/2026, 10:24:00:** The `initNetworkStateListener` was further refined to dispatch generic `evNetworkDisconnected` and `evNetworkConnected` events, removing platform-specific details from the event payload and reducing internal logging.

*   **`c:\Users\Usuario\Documents\Trabajo\MEDIAPRO\3cat_smarttv\src\components\modals\appModals\index.jsx`:**
    *   **2/2/2026, 10:29:08:** This React component defines a reusable modal system with predefined configurations for various error and informational messages (e.g., geoblocking, no connection). It exposes an `openModal` function globally and listens for `evNetworkDisconnected` and `evNetworkConnected` events to display or hide the "NO_CONNECTION" modal automatically. It also manages navigation focus when a modal is open.
    *   **2/2/2026, 10:44:30 & 10:44:43:** Briefly changed the `btnOkLabel` for the `NO_CONNECTION` modal to `null`.
    *   **2/2/2026, 10:46:07:** Reverted the `btnOkLabel` for the `NO_CONNECTION` modal back to `"TORNAR A OBRIR L'APLICACIÓ"`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **January 30, 2026:**
    *   **~11:53 - 12:33:** Intensive development and standardization of keyboard navigation and player control actions across `generic.js` and `hbbtv.js`, including the introduction of HbbTV specific key handling and key code mapping.
    *   **~12:20 - 12:21:** Initial integration and rendering of the `AppModals` component within the `DidomiContext`.
    *   **~12:29:** Initial implementation of Tizen platform specifics, including network state listening.

*   **February 2, 2026:**
    *   **~10:19 - 10:24:** Significant refactoring of Tizen network state management, shifting from direct modal calls to event dispatching.
    *   **~10:28 - 10:49:** Major enhancements to `didomiContext.jsx` to handle network disconnection and reconnection events, ensuring the consent UI responds appropriately to connectivity changes, including a brief change and reversion of state resets.
    *   **~10:29:** Initial detailed implementation of the `AppModals` component with pre-configured modal types and network event listeners.
    *   **~10:44 - 10:46:** A quick, brief change and subsequent reversion regarding the "NO_CONNECTION" modal's "OK" button label in `appModals/index.jsx`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Platform Abstraction:** Code is clearly divided by platform (`generic`, `hbbtv`, `tizen`), handling specific device APIs and key codes, but striving for a common interface for player actions and navigation (`window.AppGlobal.Player.Actions`, `nav` object).
*   **Global State (`window.AppGlobal`):** A strong pattern of attaching application-wide functions, state, and configurations to the `window.AppGlobal` object for shared access (e.g., `KeyMemory`, `keyCombinations`, `Player.Actions`, `ScreenSaver`, `Actions.openModal`).
*   **Custom Event-Driven Communication:** Frequent use of `CustomEvent` (`customKeyDown`, `customNavigation`, `customSeekKeyDown`, `evNetworkDisconnected`, `evNetworkConnected`, `evExitApplication`) for loose coupling between different parts of the application and platform integrations.
*   **Keyboard Navigation (`nav`):** A consistent, globally accessible `nav` object is used for managing UI focus and movement across different components and platforms.
*   **Modal Management:** A centralized `AppModals` component provides a robust system for displaying various application-level modals, dynamically configured and responding to global events like network changes.
*   **Consent Management (Didomi):** Deep integration of the Didomi SDK for user consent, with careful handling of its visibility and interaction, especially concerning network status.
*   **Console Logging:** Extensive logging using `ajsrConsole.log` and `console.log` for debugging and tracing execution flow across platform layers.
*   **Redundant Saves:** Several instances of identical code changes across consecutive timestamps suggest frequent saving during development or small, quickly reverted modifications.
